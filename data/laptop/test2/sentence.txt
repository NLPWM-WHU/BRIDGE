the built in camera is very useful when chatting with other techs in remote buildings on our campus .
the company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized .
i was really happy because it is a much better price on amazon.com than it was in the mac store .
heck , if i had enough ' money , i would but it as a gift for someone .
its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes .
granted , it 's still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops , my mac boots up noticeably quicker .
if you want a little more custom ability , drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of win 7 and grab a 2gb stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more .
now i could get myself a cheap computer , that will probably work a whole lot better !
it has easy to use features and all the speed and power i could ask for .
besides , the apple stocks have been falling due to lack of sales .
i made a perfect decision when i bought the toshiba !
- i propose that they can just swap the hard drives .
came with iphoto and garage band already loaded .
we also use paralles so we can run virtual machines of windows xp professional , windows 7 home premium , windows server enterprise 2003 , and windows server 2008 enterprise .
the service tech said he had tried to duplicate the damage and was n't able to recreate it therefore it had to be their defect .
my smart phone is faster !
very light and easily maneuverable .
best buy ended up junking the computer and giving me a replacement computer .
" > iphoto is probably the best program i have ever worked with : easy and convenient .
the os is fast and fluid , everything is organized and it 's just beautiful .
the ilife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product .
i love everything about this computer .
its fast , easy to use and it looks great .
this item is a beautiful piece , it works well , it is easy to carry and handle .
it is meant to be portable .
2nd mac book i have purchased from macconnection .
so if anyone is looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name toshiba on it ...
i am paying apple to kill my self and my wallet .
what 's really great about this product is you may have a family member who is computer illiterate and you can pretty much just let them loose on this computer without any real supervision .
a * big * upgrade from my 13 " 2006 macbook .
i found this laptop on sale for under 6000 at best buy which was a great deal !
i have used different laptops in the past and i have to rate this one way above the rest .
congratulations asus for creating one big piece of dump which is my laptop .
i would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .
toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought toshiba will do nothing about it .
so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault .
i was waiting for this model to be released since january , and have been holding off on buying a macbook pro until the new model came out .
everything about the mac is not only visually appealing , but very easy to use .
i 'm going back to pc .
took it back as it was defective .
it was a waste of money from day one !
i 'm honestly afraid that it will burn me , it 's that hot !
my laptop is so light that i can take it with me anywhere .
second , it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated
excellent led monitor and well equipped .
this system came loaded with windows 7 starter .
for the use it was purchased for it is a good laptop .
mac is not made for gaming .
get this machine
been a pc user for many , many years .
the tech store i purchased this from sent it back , , , , , eventually i got a new or repaired machine approximately 3 weeks later .
but , for the cost this is a winner .
it was a great deal after all .
but the arm velcro is torn after one use .
the only issue came when i tried scanning to the mac .
i got what i paid for .
best buy was great as always and accepted the return and gave me another model 1764 .
many kinds of software that is necessary to the working person is not available and can not be downloaded .
i am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook , it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop .
i 've had a toshiba laptop in the past ;
this laptop has only 2 usb ports , and they are both on the same side .
great laptop for the price , works well with action pack games .
summary : spend your money elsewhere
save your money and go for a better device .
it 's macbook pro and there is no discussion about it .
this was a significantly more affordable than getting a new macbook pro from apple .
i am loyal to apple .
there is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle , and when i click on it it says : " consider replacing your battery " and it does not hold full charge .
toshiba has a good reputation , my last computer was an acer .
typically , when i purchase a new laptop i always end up using an external mouse for convenience .
it 's catatonic .
they claim that i should be happy because i am getting a new laptop to replace my two-month old laptop .
i have owned at least 4 to 5 laptops and computers - but this is by far the most superior machine i have ever owned .
i will definitely be getting a new laptop if it has any more issues after the warranty expires and researching carefully when i do so i do n't run accross a situation like this again !
my laptop is almost 2 yrs old and i have never had any problems with it .
i just fell in love with this thing .
oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all i use the old word processor which works good .
ca n't close the 2nd hdd bay since there are brackets you have to break off ( even then , it still does n't shut ) that could be a major flaw for the dual hdd user .
the battery does n't last long but i 'm sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem .
i bought this laptop was the worst laptop i 've ever bought .
fully charged , the macbook pro can last about five hours unplugged .
the superdrive is quiet .
the mountain lion os is not hard to figure out if you are familiar with microsoft windows .
the customer service is terrific !!
the laptop preformed pretty well .
overall it 's an amazing product , 5 stars !
i like the design and its features but there are somethings i think needs to be improved .
and if you are a game player it works with world of warcraft wonderfully .
it is the easiest computer i have ever used
it did not have all the features i expected it to have .
i am now frustrated that i still have to use my work issued windows laptop !
i am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite , i like the extra features , i love the windows 7 home premium .
so we got a good deal on hsn for an acer notebook and we bought it for him .
it might be something deep within windows , for i was unable to create a disk image on my hard drive .
i highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door .
everything i wanted and everything i needed and the price was great !
it has good speed and plenty of hard drive space .
the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happening so hopefully we can get a new one very soon !
the most amazing part to me as a pc user is the startup and shutdown times - and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing .
this laptop has left me with a horrible taste in my mouth for acer brand products .
and plenty of storage with 250 gb ( though i will upgrade this and the ram . . )
it 's fast , quiet , incredibly small and affordable compared to other mac models .
that whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $ 175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $ 175 and it was fixed .
when considering a mac , look at the total cost of ownership and not just the initial price tag .
every single one we 've gotten we 've had problems with .
this is a review of windows vista system .
i ordered my 2012 mac mini after being disappointed with spec of the new 27 " imacs .
the design is awesome , quality is unprecedented .
i am now making a point to avoid their products and i hope my experience can serve as a warning to you as well .
we have n't had any problems with it at all .
" then i proceed to tell her that i checked out other retail stores that carry the netbook and it was n't like that .
i will also say it is much better than i expected !
they said that my computer was covered on an extended warranty , and that products with extended warranties are taken care of through third parties and not sony itself anymore .
i would rather spend my money on a computer that costs more than a toshiba that is n't good at all .
so you might ask , what did apple do for me ?
i spent 2200 dollars on a " top of the line laptop " .
the mac mini is about 8x smaller than my old computer which is a huge bonus and runs very quiet , actually the fans are n't audible unlike my old pc
i purchased a toshiba satellite m60 ( with harman/kardon speakers ! ) in december of 2005 .
windows also shuts the computer down for no reason without warning .
eventually we pushed hard enough to convince them that this was the machine that was causing the problems .
i have nothing to regret from this new product .
i 'm learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages .
the latest is on my lg netbook x12
it has plenty of memory , lots of hard drive , and great graphics .
i really wanted a mac over a pc because i used a mac in high school .
not the day received .
its by far faster and more stable then my pc .
i would recommend this computer to anyone searching for the perfect laptop , and the battery life is amazing .
crisp screen , great battery life , and plenty of storage .
i think it was seventy nine plus tax .
it is made better , thicker , and all out tough !
but the machine is awesome and ilife is great and i love snow leopard x .
it is super easy to use .
the software is amazing .
he gave me this pc about 3 years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it .
although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks .
apple " help " is a mixed bag .
summary : after doing some investigation on the web , i have found that toshiba nb205s are not chronically not booting .
it is easily portable and i take it everywhere i go and might require internet access .
i just hope the reputation that toshiba has is true and i wo n't have to worry about a crash .
so in late march , early april 2009 i was without it again for a couple weeks while i had online courses i had to complete and my fiance was in afghanistan and web conferencing was the best communication method we had .
windows vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service .
pairing it with an iphone is a pure pleasure - talk about painless syncing - used to take me forever - now it 's a snap .
this macbook is an outstanding product with great value .
it was not clear that the microsoft student edition that was loaded on the computer , was a six month trial .
good price .
lots of preloaded software .
anyone who is considering buying an acer computer of any sort , i seriously suggest you look into buying a different brand .
the pro is a great product , i wish that the 13 inch models came with the intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge ( the edges hurt my wrists ) .
even though it is running snow leopard , 2.4 ghz c2d is a bit of an antiquated cpu and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running office mac applications such as word or excel .
sadly apple has discontinued this macbook , i think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller pros .
actually , i had noticed the one on the sales floor also did n't have sound !
returned it to walmart .
after fumbling around with the os i started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue .
only a few days after i received the computer back , the screen froze again .
so , i thought why not give mac book pro a try .
i paid $ 800 for this computer from my school campus bookstore .
now i know !
the unibody construction is solid , sleek and beautiful .
basic computer .
definitely recommended !!!
sad very sad .
i would really recommend to any person out there to get this laptop cause its really worth it .
i absolutely love my mac !
i ca n't say enough good for it !
cosmetically , the only thing they changed was 2 of the function keys at the top .
the dvd burner broke after burning 3 dvd 'd during that time !
- they reported that the computer is in their headquarters .
its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable .
the features are great , the only thing it needs is better speakers .
yes , i thought the expese was a little much , but i now realize you get what you pay for .
if this computer every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again .
also , i have had a lot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines .
it is just slow slow slow .
as a graphic arts a retired instructor i still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art .....
no more lenovo for me .
i have loved this since i took it out of the box .
i definitely suggest getting an extended warranty , you will probably need it !
i would rate this computer at 5 stars , but considering it has a short life span i can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine .
being a pc user my whole life ....
the only problems are the sound is n't very loud i have to wear headphones .
after 2 months of complaints , asus finally sent the right power supply to my techies .
was disappointed to find out that the model had been discontinued , apparently because of known motherboard problems .
good laptop for the money .
i should have realized that trouble was brewing .
i could n't be more pleased .
it makes sorting out all those photos on my digital camera a breeze , and organizing them by place , time taken , or sending them to an online print shop , or uploading them to flickr or facebook etc , is not hard at all .
its a pretty decent computer .
got this mac mini with os x mountain lion for my wife .
i bought this laptop for my son in 2007 for his christmas present .
back then my entire family was devoted to the sony name .
it will make life so much easier next semester , just wish i had it last semester !!
with the softwares supporting the use of other os makes it much better .
the online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a pc .
i got the blue screen of death the first month i got it .
i have recently converted back to a mac and i could n't be happier !
the only thing i do n't understand is that the resolution of the screen is n't high enough for some pages , such as yahoo!mail .
i love ths notebook .
but until now , no complains at all .
i had the bulk of problems with my lap top within the first six months .
it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one .
i love my macbook pro !
it is very slim , the track pad is very much impressed with me .
dismantle the whole thing ? then it will not be a newly manufactured set like before .
here are the things that made me confident with my purchase : build quality - seriously , you ca n't beat a unibody construction .
they had to replace the motherboard in april
this is a great laptop and i would recommend it to anyone .
some days it 's just blurry , some days it appears that it 's raining on my nice desktop background of a lake and mountains .
it was truly a great computer costing less than one thousand bucks before tax .
my laptop now has no battery .
i 'm really frustrated by this experience .
it made the computer much easier to use and navigate .
simple details , crafted aluminium and real glass make this laptop blow away the other plastic ridden , bulky sticker filled laptops .
i do not like too much windows 8 .
i was ready to take it back for a refund , but the geek squad came through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed .
very happy with my 7th toshiba laptop !
this computer was awful , i would never recomend it to another person .
vista is a nightmare .
but for now , this laptop is still a workhorse .
i loaded windows 7 via bootcamp and it works flawlessly !
the only downfall is the volume control .
1 ) payed $ 2200 for a " premium " laptop
i love the quick start up .
after that the said it was under warranty .
i was so excited when my dad said i could get a new laptop for my birthday .
enough said .
but sadly the replacement froze-up while updating the bios again and shut down and would not turn back on .
runs hot i thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an apple product .
i 'm overall pleased with the interface and the portability of this product .
the battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we were sol there to , so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased .
my last laptop gave me a constant battle even though it was also completely new .
in the first month of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced .
another great thing is the beast graphics .
i decided i wanted a laptop so i went into the bby store .
do not buy it !
the screen is gorgeous - yummy good .
being a tech savvy , apple - product loving person , i 'm glad i finally got the macbook pro !
does a great job with video shot on a canon 5d mkii .
it works great and i am so happy i bought it .
this mac has been a problem since we got it .
my wife also has problems with her asus - different model .
i recommend for word processing and internet users .
get this instead , you wo n't be sorry .
i babyed the heck out of it and i still do .
i hate it !
tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again .
perfect trifecta !
ideal for someone on the go or for a high school students .
in the past few years , i 've had terrible experiences with hp .
i will only buy apple laptops from now on .
i like this machine because its very lightweight ...
apple removed the dvd drive firewire port ( will work with adapter ) and put the sdxc slot in a silly position on the back .
i run windows via bootcamp for the couple programs i do not want to buy a mac version of , like my cad programs .
i do not recommend this company or their products !!!!
it 's exactly what i wanted , and it has all the new features and whatnot .
( beware , their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is .
with notes saying they replaced the hard drive .
yes , the computer was light weight , less expensive than the average laptop , and was pretty self explanatory in use .
my dad has one of the very first toshibas ever made , yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet !
it gets stuck all of the time you use it , and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work .
i love the feel of the key board , as well as the trackpad .
the difference is the toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space .
this laptop rocks ( only wish it could run solidworks cad - which apple does n't support ) !
it 's applications are terrific , including the replacements for microsoft office .
the price is 200 dollars down .
no temporary replacement , they are out of replacements because " many computers had problems with the nvidia chipset " - inquired status of repair .
we purchase the dell xps several years ago for my home business .
i would tell the technician i knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and i had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me i needed to send the computer in .
it works !
a lot of features and shortcuts on the mbp that i was never exposed to on a normal pc .
i especially like the backlit keyboard .
really great ... well let me start at the beginning .
it caught a virus that completely wiped out my hard drive in a matter of hours .
i have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free , even without the warranty .
i now travel with this laptop and my work pc .
i had to buy a wireless mouse to go with it , as i am old school and hate the pad , but knew that before i bought it , now it works great , need to get adjusted to the key board , as i am used to a bigger one and pounding .
the pricing is very competitive .
would buy 100 more of these if i could .
so i called technical support .
i can do pretty much 75 % of what i do on my desktop on my kitchen table .
currently if i use the laptop i ca n't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs .
i fine apple mc373ll/a 2.66 ghz 15 " macbook pro notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go .
so far , it 's an average laptop - no better , no worse than the hp i replaced .
i do n't want to run a computer ; i want to use a computer .
my sister has the same mac as me and she is in a band and uses garageband to record and edit .
but the performance of mac mini is a huge disappointment .
i looked at the computer and it said updating but the asked for a product key .
and it 's so quiet that i do n't hear it at all .
- they say it will take " up to two weeks " .
with all the programs that came with it , such as ilife and iwork , i was set from the very beginning .
when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke .
the mousepad is a huge pain in the arse !
i just recently had to ship my laptop back to hp for repair .
i do everything on this computer - check email , facebook , shop , check blogs , write papers , listen to music , and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv .
the difference is it 's a whole lot of fun using the laptop now , still learning the apple navigation , but is fun and comes with a lot of cool apps .
i did not take the class and wish that i would have .
i like it !
those moments in time where you want to throw something against the wall ? yeah , i wanted to throw that laptop out the window and light it on fire .
i got a mac as my hs graduation gift .
when you call tech support you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing .
mom , dad , brother , sister , you name it !
its good for playing my apps on facebook or watching movies .
it is so speedy .
i 'm pretty sure it 's not newegg 's fault but when you turn on a computer you just bought you want it to at least get to desktop .
they sent it off and within 2 weeks i had it back good as new .
we were occasional mac users before , but most recently owned a budget pc since it is what we could afford .
it suddenly can not work .
a seventy dollar mouse !
high price tag , however .
toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done .
people know what they are talking about and they have pride in the product that they are selling .
even though it is much more expensive than many pc laptops , it is worth the price .
i went with him and we picked this one .
i would recommend this product .
hopefully my replacement is brand new .
returned laptop for a 4th repair and it came back but now would lock up and randomly reboot frequently making the laptop unusable .
this mac is great !
who knows what will happen later on when they dismantle the whole damn thing ? so , i said i wanted a new set .
yeah , to you .
his was worth $ 36 .
i sit down and use my husband 's work pc and i do n't like it one bit .
but i am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it .
and it is impossible to get them back in .
for me i was lucky and a local store was selling them for $ 2000 off and best buy matched their price so i was able to buy one for under $ 1000
also , you wo n't have to worry about them going online a getting a virus .
about 1/2 of the sites i need to visit because of my work contain some type of flash .
the only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2.0 hrs when not plugged in .
the display on this computer is the best i 've seen in a very long time , the battery life is very long and very convienent .
when we bought our new hp computer in dec. of 2008 , we wanted windows xp , but were told it would cost an extra $ 159 , so we went with vista .
maybe it 's acer , maybe it 's msft .
consumer report recommended toshiba .
the memory was gone and it was not able to be used .
this machine rocks !
i am also upset with cr for giving a good rating .
it could n't have been a better decision .
more times that not the screen pops up saying i have a bad internet connection , or the page ca n't be displayed .
i had meant to purchase the nb205 and bought this one by accident ( long story ) .
the only thing that i have , is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters , would help if it was a little lighter then it is .
i love it !
its perfect , not much heavy .
it is very easy for anyone to use an apple and specially the macbook pro notebook .
small and still very powerful .
took a while to clean it up to my specs .
i had in the past a dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it .
i have used a computer at work but having your own personal laptop is awsome !
his language was so bad i swore i was taking the turing test , and it was failing .
from the build quality to the performance , everything about it has been sub-par from what i would have expected from apple .
i work as a designer and coder and i needed a new buddy to work with , not gaming .
winters is on it 's way and i imagine it will be cozy .
the notebook is lacking a hdmi port and a s-video port that would enable one to hook it to a tv .
this is the first macbook i have ever had .
i believe i purchased this in dec 09 for my primary work laptop which is used 5-10 hours a day , 4-6 days a week .
i have had it 9 months and it is already a $ 250 loss .
skype is just so dang cool with this machine too .
i got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime i touched the lid , ( mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed ) but i suffered thru it and would constantly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out .
i found the mini to be : exceptionally easy to set up
i was amazed at how fast the delivery was .
and i may be the only one but i am really liking windows 8 .
they told me to reprogram the computer , and i did n't need to do that , and i lost pictures of my oldest first 2 years of her life .
i think it was around 16 hundred bucks last i checked .
all my devises “ talk ” to each other .
i had to get apple customer support to correct the problem .
the macbook is a fantastic laptop .
the graphics are stunning .
the computer blinks it shuts off at will .
bought it to use mostly for online classes .
not working = bad
but sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough ( this could be because im used to my lenovo 10 tablet now ) plus this is a great size if i want to unplug the external keyboard , mouse , and monitor to take it with me when i take photos and video .
not too expense and has enough storage for most users and many ports .
the " abuse " is that i pushed the power plug in too hard .
it is more than enough computer to keep up with the needs of a high school student .
this is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components , and i 'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator , but i still expected better product quality for this price range .
my parents bought it for me as a graduation gift , and i 'm totally ( almost kind of maybe definitely ) obsessed with it .
which i still use and have hooked up to my tv .
the book is useless .
words can not express how much i love my new mac .
love it .
i will be returning it and switching brands when i get to best buy .
why not 5 stars ?
it 's just a great toy to have around .
( i 'm an excellent touch typist , and my hands are very sensitive , too .
the one thing i wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel .
this machine is amazing .
i hate it .
awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college .
the delivery was fast , and i would not hesitate to purchase this laptop again .
i 'm not exaggerating when i say this computer is perfect ... it is !!
hieroglyphics are quite common .
there are reviews that speak to a few possible glitches but , i have n't seen them yet .
i burned my leg , after lifting it from my desk , and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table , so i can place it there .
so far , a great product .
the cons are more annoyances that can be lived with .
the apple macbook pro nothing to say but professionally great and outstanding .
just for a stupid cd .
just bit the bullet and bought the mac hoping it will last a lot longer … .
if you could stretch by a few 100 dollars i highly recommend you should replace your windows laptop with this one .
it 's small but powerful , light but strong , elegant and beautiful ... in resume : it 's a mac !
i needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria .
i think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive , but i rather have a hard copy .
so i called , again .
pc users use the powerpoint program for slide-show presentation and mac users utilize keynote .
otherwise this little notebook has met all my expectations .
this device has met my expectations and i 'm sure it will meet yours .
5 months dead again .
it is always reliable , never bugged and responds well .
macs are amazing !!
i still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to !
i got this laptop on black friday .
yet , hp wo n't do anything about the problem .
i am so addict to this laptop .
) and printing from either word processor is an adventure .
mac tutorials do help .
she said its very user friendly .
this is what i call a good after sales service .
it 's slow and one day i hope to have the money to get rid of it and buy something else .
i consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need .
thinking about returning it
all for such a great price .
i 'm really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer .
buy the mac mini it 's a terribly great machine .
i had a little problem adjusting to the small screen but works fine as long as i remember to carry my glasses .
well , i started using google chrome , which is a little better , but it freezes too sometimes .
this system is not worth the money or trouble trying to get it fix .
either way i 'm furious .
i 've have n't had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off .
the port is secured to motherboard so when this happens you ca n't see the plug at all , it 's just gone .
now that i have it i see that i really needed this for much more .
easy to install also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to configure for adsl cable or wifi .
so honestly , i was n't expecting anything less than perfection , and i was n't disappointed .
finally set the unit back to hp after a month of hell .
i also like the acer arcade but these were really the only two things i liked about this laptop .
all the problems i have had with pc 's are solved with a mac : the issue of overheating - my dell was always overheating and not working properly or simply shutting off , and the issue of viruses and contaminants - my hp completely quit working within2 years of purchasing it , with no inexpensive way of fixing it .
the fact that you can spend over $ 100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine .
really like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints .
i love my samsung tv and galaxy s smartphone , but this netbook was a very poor computer .
the only thing i wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16 " laptop does .
recently there are a few incidents that annoy the hell out of me .
after doing extensive research , macconnection had the lowest price on the 15 " mbp i5 .
i was a little weary at purchasing another 13 " macbook almost 2 years later but t looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics cards in order this time around .
i enjoy very much my new toshiba , purchased specifically for attending online schooling .
the dell mini was the first dell product that i had ever purchased .
features such as the dashboard ( allows you to view frequently used tools like a calculator , weather forecast , movie times , calendar , computer post its etc .
the os is great .
i already own an iphone , and so the move just made more sense .
i blame the mac os .
this was the second computer and brand bought that day .
i have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied .
enough said .
did not enjoy the new windows 8 and touchscreen functions .
when i finally held it in my hands i kissed it , yes i did .
it doesnt overheat or make any loud noises .
when i got my laptop back after this first instance it worked okay for a little bit then i started experiencing issues again , everything from programs and drivers failing again , to it powering off for no reason , to locking up and freezing and just all sorts of issues .
a tip for people looking into this computer : do not buy it save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .
i bought mine from apple store the day it was released as amazon did n't have it yet .
this was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped .
one of the primary reasons why i purchased an ipad was to store photographs so that i could show to my customers .
keyboard is great , very quiet for all the typing that i do .
i ca n't believe how quiet the hard drive is and how quick this thing boots up .
i 've owned this labtop for less then two months , already the mouse button has broke .
very good quality and well made .
could n't have asked for more !
would pay more for it if i had too !
( i had been a windows / linux user before this ) i love the size because the screen is big enough for what i use it for ( internet , artwork ) , and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable .
many people complain about the new os , and it 's urgent for apple to fix it asap !
just a bunch of idiots who 's english as a 5th language is forced at best .
buyer beware .
replaced this one with my mac that was stolen , its a great computer .
this laptop meets every expectation and windows 7 is great !
i challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it .
the graphics on this computer are also stellar - very clear and vivid .
macs are designed for the " frontal lobe challenged " people out there .
fan vents to the side , so no cooling pad needed , great feature !
my iphone synced right up just like a person would expect , unlike the pcs in our lives .
the perfect notebook ...
if you want more information on macs i suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications .
update : two years after buying this laptop , i am now the proud owner of a lemon .
i should have been more observant .
simply amazing computer !!
this is the first laptop i 've owned , although i used several at my previous job .
it 's light and easy to transport .
it was n't worth it .
there is hardly any memory on the computer 's hard drive .
it is not an easy decision to purchase a used or even good as new laptop but i am very satisfied .
i use this for my tutoring business , and since i 'm always bouncing from student to student , it is ideal for portability and battery life ( yes , it gets the 8 hours as advertised ! ) .
it runs perfectly .
* 2 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - called headquarters , they report that they have not looked at it yet but it is " on the top of the stack " .
i 've also had to have the keyboard replaced at my expense .
incredible graphics and brilliant colors .
i charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery life .
after doing cad work all day at work , using a higher end pc , i could n't come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer .
solution : it turned out to be pretty simple .
it 's not inexpensive but the hardware performance is impressive for a computer this small .
the driver updates do n't fix the issue , very frustrating .
very small and portable i 've had this netbook about 12 hrs now and it 's better than expected .
which is what i did , check out my acer 5517 !
company provides ups shipping , fast , great !
it is light and the battery last a very long time .
asked the customer service rep .
still trying to learn how to use it .
product support very poor as each phone call costs me long distan
it works really well .
it 's priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box .
obviously , this macbook is perfect for me because it does exactly what i need in an easy-to-function way .
by this time i was regretting ever seeing this machine on the shelf !
tried to make a recovery disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk .
i especially like the keyboard which has chiclet type keys .
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is .
it 's fast at loading the internet .
took that one home , same thing .
he loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started .
the reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me ( i prefer it dark ) or if you can crank up the brightness .
it is a bit heavy .
- stay away from apple , or hope you laptop does not break down .
i 'm going back to dell .
the material this pro is made out of seems a lot nicer than any pc specs : like i said this performs a lot better than any computer i 've had in the past .
i 'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100 % that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence .
excellent speed for processing data .
i 'll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba .
love this laptop wonderful price for what you get !
it was heavy , bulky , and hard to carry because of the size .
which is great i am running vista business and scored a 5.x on the index i have never seen a windows machine have a total score in the 5 's .
i decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it .
i love this program , it is superior to windows movie maker .
i was very excited because this was my first personal computer and i was purchasing it with my own money i had recieved from graduation presents .
the toshiba satellite has been more than i expected for the price .
i am a wife , mom and a school teacher and a college student .
i picked it out because it was inexpensive ( $ 400 ) and i thought it would be a good , easy to use first laptop .
the programs are great , like iphoto ( love the editing capabilities ) , imail ( which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad ) , imovie , etc .
i bought it during the recent comex it show .
/ awesome cooling system / much better graphics card ( ati 5870 ) / 8gb ram / led backlit screen ...
which was way too much money .
it still serves me well both in business and home needs .
very very slow laptop .
i bought this macbook pro to replace my six-year-old pc ( a sony vaio ) , but it was basically no better than my old pc , so i returned it .
there are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new macbook !
it is a cheap throw together .
honestly , i am surprised no one else has mentioned returning theirs .
look up recipes and keep it on the kitchen counter while i cook .
it is not even a year old yet , so i would definitely not recommend it to anyone .
cheaper than buying it @ apple too !
my husband got me this for chrismas after getting me a very expensive laptop that did not work after 2 days .
you can do absolutely anything and is very fast and stylish .
you may need to special order a bag .
plus two finger clicking as a replacement for the right click button is surprisingly intuitive .
it was an all around waste of money for me .
i actually had the hard drive replaced twice , the mother board once , the dvd drive twice , then they finally agreed to replace it , ( all of this in less than 1-1/2 years !
- i give up on my data , i just want a computer reasonably fast ...
it does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern .
i love the keyboard .
stop living in the stone age and buy a mac , you will not be sorry at all !!
i 'm a professional consultant , and a client needed work on her machine .
i will never buy another hp computer .
shipping was quick and product described was the product sent and so much more ...
i finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what i need it .
the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm .
i had my iworks , itunes , email , ms office , network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour .
love the stability of the mac software and operating system .
deal of the year .
i was looking for something in between a regular laptop and a tablet and this is it .
this is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine ;
to this day , there are none .
added an imac about 2 years later .
set up was easy .
all the above aside this machine rocks !
it is extremely user friendly and intuitive .
the switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop .
i 've had it for about 2 months now and found no issues with software or updates .
purchased as a gift for a friend .
everything is falling apart internally and externally .
- apple offers to send replacement and after 10 days i send them the old computer .
in fact , somehow ( and i never opened it up ) some specks of dust or something got inside the screen and are now there permanently , behind the front of the screen , in the way of the display .
received the product promptly and without any issues .
this computer is really fast and i 'm shocked as to how easy it is to get used to ...
i also travel with it and it never gives me any problems .
as with any laptop not purchased with software options , it comes with a lot of what i consider useless applications .
im glad that it has such great features in it .
size : i know 13 is small ( especially for a desktop replacement ) but with an external monitor , who cares .
had to have this computer repaired twice in the first 5 months after purchasing it .
this apple navigates you thru the unexplored world of the internet .
i have owned many different brands of laptops in my life .
it is very easy to type on and feels great - besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted .
it 's a mac !!
i have had a mac for 6 years and wo n't go back to pc .
purchased a toshiba lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out .
needless to say , the leap from that to this has been amazing and ( aside from the financial reasons ) i am astounded that i had n't made the switch sooner .
i do n't do any high tech stuff on it , just write papers , check mail , and sometimes play games , so i ca n't recommend it if you are in the computer field .
the computer would not ever cut back on .
screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment .
also , i have alot of trouble with it getting very hot , and not even sitting on anything to make it hot .
the apple pro notebook will not let you down .
then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me .
however i dealt with this problem for over a year and it was more of a hastle then i have ever had with anything .
shipped very quickly and safely .
not enough time for me to give it 5 stars !
i initially purchased my macbook pro 13 " in april , and i loved it .
other than that , i would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities .
it is quiet and a real joy to watch work .
getting the apple care plan is a must .
they went through asking me open up various components , taking battery out , hard disk apart , and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it .
the only thing that can be updated is the video , other than that you 're all set .
the keyboard , which generally felt okay even for someone used to a desktop keyboard , now looks terrible .
it has a lot of memory and a great battery life .
mostly i love the drag and drop feature .
if someone called me an apple fanboy it would make sense .
this computer is also awesome for my sons virtual home schooling .
i had to call apple 19 times ( each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone ) , and take it to their store for evaluations , and diagnostics , 5 times .
get this computer for portability and fast processing !!!
it has a overheating issue - nearly to the point of being dangerous .
you 'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them .
when i am next to my router on my hp i get full service , on my eee pc i get 3 bars .
drivers updated ok but the bios update froze the system up and the computer shut down .
after 5 months of failed repairs , requested a full refund but was refused and it still is not repaired and acer is indifferent to the issue .
so , the hard disk capacity really does n't matter to me .
i will never buy another computer from dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how i was treated by the company .
the bluetooth was not there at all , and the fingerprint reader driver would be there , but the software would hang after installation was 1/2 way done .
fast , great visual !
the repairs were made quickly though i must say , however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me .
i love the apple products .
now they are believers in the product .
i do n't know why i did n't make the switch sooner ... o ya because it 's expensive .
) only to get another " hp/compaq " piece of crap .
in addition , all the design tools on pages and keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations .
i believe with apple - you get what you pay for .
) i also purchased applecare for $ 300 , which is a three year extended warranty , since i ve never seen any laptop that lasted more than two .
still under warrenty so called toshiba , no help at all .
please make these !
small and light weight .
now the screen is going darker , darker , darker .
this is why i purchased a brand new laptop in the first place so it would n't have any problems .
they are n't worth the money , even though they are on the cheap side , laptop speaking .
mac also has many apps and programs that are quite cheap or free .
pros : the macbook pro notebook has a large battery life and you wont have to worry to charge your laptop every five hours or so .
hp refused to give me a new one and wal mart refused to take it back .
i have always wanted a macbook pro always !
even with virus protection , it always turned off when updates were needed and installed .
buy this .
bought this gateway m-50 or 150 early 2007 .
this computer gets very hot , before shutting down .
so , buyers beware !
my son said it popped up and he clicked update .
i am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when i got back in town .
this is something i would deffinately recommend to someone .
the feel of this machine compared to the old macbook is far superior .
i was going to buy today and noticed it went back up to $ 344.99 ?
with a healthy pessimism , i took the machine home and tried to find a flaw .
all apple associates are always willing to help you out with anything , no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed .
they do n't crash .
the games included are very good games .
needless to say i told them no and have a nice day and hung up !
runs fast and the regular layout keyboard is so much better .
love it i 've always been an apple fan boy , but never had the money to buy a mac , only ipads and iphones , and this is my first mac , blew me away completely .
i am an info sys major in college , so i started researching this issue on my own .
my macbook is so much better looking and so thin !
that 's a huge difference .
i am loving the fast performance also .
i love windows 7 but i ca n't give toshiba any credit for that , unless you all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time .
screen is awesome , battery life is good .
thank you so much for the great item .
after a little more than a year of owning my macbook pro , the monitor has completely died .
everything about this computer is easy to use .
i was n't really sure i wanted to spend that kind of money !
most of them were either too big , too noisy and too slow after 2 years .
i was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that i was looking for .
it was getting old and i needed a new school computer .
i made a photo book as a gift , on my computer , pushed " buy " and it drew from my itunes account and sent the book to my house , the book was of perfect quality - exactly how i had created it and looked better than i had even imagined .
- i propose that i can just swap the hard drives .
this laptop looked brand new and was shipped very quickly .
the reason why i choose apple macbook because of their design and the aluminum casing .
so what am i supposed to do ? the lg service center can not provide me the " service " when it is called the " service center " .
not to mention it has shit gigs .
the photobooth is a great program , it takes very good pictures with the built-in camera .
i purchased my first mac and am glad i did .
you wo n't have to spend gobs of money on some inefficient virus program that needs to be updated every month and that constantly drains your wallet .
i love how easy every thing is to do on my apple products .
as an owner of a toshiba satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy .
as a lifelong windows user , i was extremely pleased to make the change to mac .
i seem to be having repeat problems as the mother board in this one is diagnosed as faulty , related to the graphics card .
overall the computer is very easy to use , the screen is perfect , great computer , my daughter loves .
on the bright side at least i was n't without my laptop for long this time !
besides the great look , it is a great machine .
i had to pay for the shipping !
my children wo n't even use it for their school work .
i just hope this expensive laptop does n't go dead like my friends ... it did last him 5 good years before it bit the dust .
my favorite by far , although the most expensive , was my sony .
the price and features more than met my needs .
and then , a guy came out to serve me instead .
strong build though which really adds to its durability .
be sure to have good air flow where ever you put it .
i stayed up half the night enjoying my new macbook pro .
i bought this laptop and found its tab is not functioning .
spent 2 hours on phone with hp technical support .
i have never had it crash , randomly turn off ,
i do n't have any technical pearls to share .
overall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive .
let me start off by saying that i was highly reluctant to spend so much money on a laptop .
i could not handle it one hand like i can the replacement computer i purchased .
it all just makes sense .
later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months .
the technical service for dell is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother .
i had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity , because it is very sensitive .
they 're not safe , they 're not durable , they just a worthless .
( the ibook backup also uses a firewire connection ) .
i enjoy having apple products .
microsoft seems to be unable to keep up with repairs for the multitude of windows problems .
the item received was exactly as identified .
i bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room ;
tech support would not fix the problem unless i bought your plan for $ 150 plus .
i loved it then , but unfortunately it was before the days of wireless internet .
i love the way the entire suite of software works together .
i took it back for a full refund .
i am used to computers with windows so i am having a little difficulty finding my way around .
so far , so good !
this is one of the reasons i purchased it .
and the fact that apple is driving the 13 " rmbp with the intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered ( to me .
not even safe mode boots .
i only used it to browse the internet and and i dont know how many times it has spontaneously shut down and it is just a blank screen now .
that system is fixed .
they are simpler to use .
the best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features .
also , macbooks come with much more features which are so cool !
and as for all the fancy finger swipes -- i just gave up and attached a mouse .
perfect -- thanks so .
i have a friend who has the other model and we put them side by side with the same dvd in ( battle of the smithsonian ) after on hour mine was at 53 % life left and his was at 69 % life left .
this laptop is fast and you will literally learn all you can do with this dynamo by just watching the online tutorials .
again - windows based machines were not giving me anything to work with !
within a few hours i was using the gestures unconsciously .
its office compatible , but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs .
you will not regret it , promise you !
if you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports and a dual core amd or intel processor .
i paid for a new laptop , but was sent a used one .
although i opted for the lowest end macbook pro , this thing holds its own .
my computer froze on several occasion , had buttons that randomly would fall off and even had moments when the computer would refuse to turn on at all .
you can even run a parallels type program easily and run any leftover pc software that you absolutely can not be without .
there was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system ca n't be used with the ibook .
moral of the story : - do not buy anything from companies that do not respect their customers .
i bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market .
the # 1 reason that is always repeated .
you will fall in love with it in no time .
the people are frustrating to work with , the product itself is very cheaply made , and the accessories are less than satisfactory .
i am just one of the million customers .
it is also very lightweight , making transporting this computer very easy .
now am very apprehensive about toshiba laptops .
the large screen gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or tv shows on your computer instead of buying an additional tv for your dorm room .
however , the experience was great since the os does not become unstable and the application will simply shutdown and reopen .
can you buy any laptop that matches the quality of a macbook ?
this computer was awful !
acer has set me up with free recovery discs , when they are available since i asked .
i really do n't like it , but i am stuck .
what a waste of time it was to run a defrag on the pc !
after replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working ( 3 months of use ) which was frustrating .
very happy with my purchase .
i took it in to the apple store and guess what ? they fixed it , no cost out of pocket .
prior to this computer , i owned a powerbook g4 for 6 years ( quite a long time for a laptop ) .
: - ) if you buy this - do n't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life , and you 'll be perfectly satisfied .
sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to work
and they replaced the awesome ergonomic small lightweight power supply with a power supply that weighed more than the machine itself .
after about another month i had to send it in again to acer for repairs .
toshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it .
i would like at least a 4 hr . battery life .
it seems they could have updated xp and done without creating vista .
and i would recommend this to anyone looking for a new laptop .
my only problem is i can not reg . the product key .
the board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues .
the manufacturer 's warranty only covers replacement/repair of parts .
lord have mercy !
i ca n't begin to say how disappointed i am .
the macbook rarely requires a hard reboot .
all the ports are much needed since this is my main computer .
thank you for your great product !
and if u did .
in fact i still use many legacy programs ( appleworks , filemaker pro , quicken , photoshop etc ) !
bought notebook 07/2009 .
i have in the past gotten superfine sandpaper and " fixed " the edges by rounding them off .
i have had some excellent computer and have found i had no idea what to do with them
but sony said we could send it back and be charged for adding the bluetooth an additional seventy something dollars .
i had it four months when my disc drive refused to open .
runs very smoothly .
also the battery is completely shot .
the mcbook pro notebook will make it easy for you to write and read your emails at blazing speeds .
the speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones i have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music i suggest you get something better .
also , if you need to talk to a representative at microsoft , there is a charge , which i believe is robbery , since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system , which most people would have went with xp if they could .
this computer i used daily nice compact design .
i went right out and purchased another laptop .
its ease of use and the top service from apple - be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar - can not be beat .
i 'm not going to lie , i 've never really liked the acer brand in general .
i 've only had mine a day but i 'm already used to it ...
there is a blank lighted screen when i start and that is all .
luckily , dell said they would replace my laptop with a new one , but instead i got a refund and bought a mac .
i needed a laptop with big storage , a nice screen and fast so i can photoshop without any problem .
first of all , they had no record of me having the 3 year warranty i 'd paid almost $ 400 for , and i had to call in , spend hours on their online chat service , and fax in multiple documents .
it is , however , very heavy .
there is nothing to complain about the system .
the track pad is a bit squirrely at times - sometimes too sensitive , and sometimes a bit unresponsive , but it 's usable .
i wanted it for it 's mobility and man , this little bad boy is very nice .
there has been no problem with anything .
then hp sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up , not able to connect .
the other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes , the most common being a corrupted version of appleworks which can render the browser useless .
dell wanted to charge us for everything everytime i called them with a problem .
thanks for great service and shipping !
maybe the mac os improvement were not the product they want to offer .
the i5 blows my desktop out of the water when it comes to rendering videos .
with a mac computer i have more free time as i do n't have to wait for windows to boot up or shut down and all the viruses associated with windows .
pretty much made sense to get a mini .
it was about six months later when the overheating problem started again , to the point it felt like fire on the bottom of the machine !
overall this laptop is great .
there is no need to open a program first and the click open or import .
ease of use is just one of the benefits i love about my mac .
of course my warranty runs out next month .
you wo n't be disappointed .
the built-in webcam is great for skype and similar video-chat services .
if i have a few hundred dollars to spare , i 'd buy the pro line though , the 2.53 and 2.66 ghz model .
at $ 1899 to start , this is no cheap machine .
it has happened again and i 'm being told that it 's $ 175 .
the criticism has waned , and now i 'd be the first to recommend an air for truly portable computing .
while about 8 years ago , i hope that the quality has changed .
when i got this laptop in 2007 to help me with school , i had a hard time from beginning .
typing on the keyboard becomes uncomfortable after extended use due to the sharp edges that your wrists rest on .
however , if i sound enthusiastic about this , i am !
( no problem with the ordering or shipping by the way .
the computer is currently in west verginia doe to the method of shipping chosen by toshiba .
even though i could have gotten a pc twice the speed for the same price i still think there 's nothing like a mac .
after talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate , i chose the macbook pro over the white macbook .
everything was up and running within 15 minutes of unboxing .
99 to fix it .
i had to have these computers in my school .
the audio volume is quite low and virtually unusable in a room with any background activity .
it is really easy to use and it is quick to start up .
this was absolutely annoying !
it 's a lottery at this point as i have read that other have received new ones with the same problem .
their products , including the mbp , are beautiful , sleek and clever .
! excellent performance , usability , presentation and time response .
needs longer lasting battery , more than 1 to 2 hrs .
the battery life was shorter than expected .
apple is living up to its name with the mini and , for our needs , it 's perfect .
much of which hp ended up paying for .
both my husband and i have this model toshiba .
this machine delivers .
further , this mac mini has a sloppy bluetooth interface ( courtesy of the mac os ) and the range is poor .
the case is carved out of a single block of aluminum .
do you ever think hp would do that ? never !
i will be patient for few months .
i think that they are the best out on the market .
i had a toshiba for 10 years .
i lost two items i was working on until i figured out what was happening .
this laptop is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases .
iphoto is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social networking sites .
the macbook pro is extremely thin and light compared to those heavy windows laptop .
trashed it when i spilled a latte on it while writing at a cafe .
so not having my laptop was discouraging .
the apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you : )
the track pad to me is what really stands out though , you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad , awesome thinking apple !
good bye blue screen and critical errors !!!!
i bought this emachines notebook pc in january of this year and i am highly dissatisfied with it .
it was so exciting for me to unwrap my new mac .
so i called compaq , and after being on the phone for 3 hours , i finally got a replacement which i should n't have had a problem getting since it was under warranty .
after purchasing this thing , i find out that i need a special interface device to connect my camera , and that it can not be purchased at the store - only on line .
in short , you could say your mac could become your best friend ( no intention of replacing rover your dog ) .
they offer the best warranty in the business , and do n't 3rd party it out like toshiba .
no star for this trash . [ ...
as it turns out , i just did n't know any better .
it 's a joke .
it 's all a bit magical .
originally bought it for my wife .
gradually the freezing screen evolved into a screen that froze in weird shapes .
stay away from hp .
it doesnt work worth a damn .
then , one month after the warranty expired , the replacement charger went .
they are closed at 9 pm eastern .
this netbook went bad on me after 3 days .
the notebook pc , toshiba qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me .
clear picture on it and everything .
this laptop is a great price and has a sleek look .
this computer is exceptionally thin for it 's screen size and processing power .
it easily fits into most computer bags but does n't weigh down a backpack or satchel when being carried with spirals and/or textbooks .
i 've been a pc user and i just finally switched and i am never going back .
i do find that my macbook has a lot more bells and whistles than a normal pc especially if you enjoy technology , downloading pictures and graphic design .
this is perfect for her field .
i bought this one for my 11 year old and the macbook air for my 9 year old .
it is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed .
theres a built in camera with special effects - for video and photography .
although the price is higher then dell laptops , the macbooks are worth the dough .
you pay for what you get for .
i can have both osx and windows xp running at the same time !
i have had my dell latitude for almost three years .
it weighed like seven pounds or something like that .
and it did n't show up on the reciept , i do n't know how we ordered it online !
i would recommend mac , and do , to anyone looking to buy a new computer .
i my wife is also now the proud owner of a macbook as well !
and if you do a lot of writing , editing is a problem since there is no forward delete key .
but other then that i would give this product a 4 in hafe stars .
osx lion is a great performer . . extremely fast and reliable .
i like it so much , i bought another just for my wife .
the screen gets smeary and dusty very quickly and it 's very noticeable .
we have had numerous problems with vista , such as adobe flash player just quits and has to be uninstalled and then reinstalled , internet explore just quits and you lose whatever you were working on , also , the same windows update has appeared on this computer since we got it and has been updated probably 400 times , the same update .
i 'm the pro-active type so i went off and did some preventative fixes .
user friendly , fast and high tech it is amazing !
i have other computers that get strong signals that do n't drop in places that this " net " book loses its signal .
we are addicted to the mac .
since then i have had minor problems with slow operation .
i contacted hp about this situation and was given excuses , without results .
in addition , there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture .
remember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product .
i tell everyone that i know , friends , family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used .
it played various games without problems and ran aero smoothly and flawlessly .
it was slow , locked up , and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months !
this newer netbook has no hard drive or network lights .
looks nice , but has a horribly cheap feel .
i asked how they would determine that since there are no scratches , dents or other signs of damage and was told that was the only way this type of damage could happen .
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse .
so i got another netbook which i love !
this computer does everything i need it to do for school and more .
they really screwed the pooch on this one .
if you 're looking for a great laptop , you 've found the best here .
i am not happy at all with the product i purchased .
i like the lighted screen at night .
considering another computer should be out of the question
some features are n't friendly ( volume wheel , sound quality , etc .
do a quick search on the internet see if im the only one .
i ' have had it for about a 1-1/2 and yes i have had an issue with it one month out of warranty .
so far , so good .
i noticed windows has a new system called windows 7 , what about us vista users ? they should get all the bugs out of vista before investing in a new system .
the only pro to this computer is it was under $ 600 !
the specs are pretty good too .
but let me tell you , the mac book pro is so professional .
they claim call center is still down .
i called back to ensure that received it , they had .
the performance is definitely superior to any computer i 've ever put my hands on .
treat yourself to a more expensive , long-lasting laptop of quality like a sony , apple , or toshiba .
thank you best buy for putting my computer together and installing my first software - you guys were great too !
the great 18 month same as cash financing and advance protection plan which includes accidents like spills .
most of the large bags are for a 17 inch .
hope this helped !
when you look at the specs on apple products in comparison to a dell or a hp , yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost .
needless to say a pc that ca n't support a cell phone is less than useless !
customization on mac is impossible .
sent unit back and it 's been two months .
the mini 's body has n't changed since late 2010 - and for a good reason .
the computer first started malfunctioning 3 months after purchasing it .
they were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place .
a month later , we reinstall the os ( vista ) .
took several hours with customer support before i could even start the pc out of the box .
call tech support , standard email the form and fax it back in to us .
os x is solid with lots of innovations such as quicklook which save heaps of time .
the macbook pro is really responsive .
i 've had my computer for 2 weeks already and it works perfectly .
if a website ever freezes ( which is rare ) , its really easy to force quit .
i like coming back to mac os but this laptop is lacking in speaker quality compared to my $ 400 old hp laptop .
a mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense .
sells for the same as a netbook without sacrificing size .
since i never really got to use this , i ca n't comment on anything except what went wrong after trying 2 of them .
the speed is incredible and i am more than satisfied .
unable to boot up this brand new laptop .
i loved it .
it 's great for streaming video and other entertainment uses .
its sad because their commercials are great .
the so called laptop runs to slow and i hate it !
the internet can be an scary place its up to you on what you do with it .
it is fast and i have not had a problem with internet connection or any other problems .
it 's just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open .
no installation disk ( dvd ) is included .
i did add a ssd drive and memory
