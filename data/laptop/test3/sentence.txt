my house is now 100 % macbook .
another problem .
huge apple mac fan !
if i have a few hundred dollars to spare , i 'd buy the pro line though , the 2.53 and 2.66 ghz model .
the battery is not as shown in the product photos .
i had the bulk of problems with my lap top within the first six months .
so , i paid a visit to lg notebook service center at alexandra road , hoping they can make the hinge tighter .
the whole experience is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop .
ideal for someone on the go or for a high school students .
my favorite by far , although the most expensive , was my sony .
the mousepad is a huge pain in the arse !
there is a backlit keyboard which is perfect for typing in the dark .
the new os is great on my macbook pro !
the screen is gorgeous - yummy good .
it is more than enough computer to keep up with the needs of a high school student .
had to have this computer repaired twice in the first 5 months after purchasing it .
it 's not inexpensive but the hardware performance is impressive for a computer this small .
i have dropped mine a couple times with only a slim plastic case covering it .
it did fairly well , other than it 's poor performance , overheating and occational blue screen .
then to make matters worst , there is noone that they can transfer you to .
i 'm going back to pc .
when the computer has been on for several minutes , it will occasionaly just go off by itself .
the newer macbook that i have purchased is one of the best computers .
i love the operating system and the preloaded software .
i needed something affordable from apple and was tired of dealing with pc laptop after pc laptop .
so far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and i am praying it has finally stopped .
the apple pro notebook will not let you down .
recently there are a few incidents that annoy the hell out of me .
after 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off .
in the shop , these macbooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it , get it home , break the seal and use it ( very clever con ) .
this laptop looked brand new and was shipped very quickly .
of course , for a student , weight is always an issue .
i bought this macbook pro to replace my six-year-old pc ( a sony vaio ) , but it was basically no better than my old pc , so i returned it .
breaking within 1 year of purchase and speaking to 4 + people to report the damaged part will be returned late !
it works fine , and all the software seems to run pretty well .
a couple things you should know :
i love ths notebook .
it took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back .
it s heavy for mac book but is good .
came with iphoto and garage band already loaded .
so you might ask , what did apple do for me ?
sadly apple has discontinued this macbook , i think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller pros .
the machine itself is alright .
the price is higher than most lab top out there ; however , he/she will get what they paid for , which is a great computer .
i can not be happier with the service or product .
i would have to say that overall its great !
it may take a little getting used to but you do n't have to worry about viruses or other headaches .
graphics are clean and sharp , internet interfaces are seamless .
yeah , it 's super expensive .
it has good speed and plenty of hard drive space .
so this was great for me .
laptop is advertised as a 15 " but the casing looks like that of a 17 " .
sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to work
summary : they played games with me for the warranty period .
the performance seems quite good , and built-in applications like iphoto work great with my phone and camera .
i should have been more observant .
for the use it was purchased for it is a good laptop .
the computer itself was fast , ran smoothly , and had no problems .
the reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me ( i prefer it dark ) or if you can crank up the brightness .
the os is fast and fluid , everything is organized and it 's just beautiful .
best buy was great as always and accepted the return and gave me another model 1764 .
i did n't like one thing about it .
awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college .
not sure how i recommend it for quality gaming , as i have a desktop rig for that reason .
they ended up keeping my computer for almost 3 months !
the 17 in macbook pro has been a wonderful addition .
took that one home , same thing .
i love the size , keyboard , the functions .
delivery was early too .
great purchase and i definitely did n't miss out on the black friday deals .
i am very happy with my first mac .
i bought it to my son who uses it for graphic design .
set up was easy .
a longer battery life would have been great - but it meets it 's spec quite easily .
the screen takes some getting use to , because it is smaller than the laptop .
i homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat .
good in every aspect .
awesome graphics !
it 's so quick and responsive that it makes working / surfing on a computer so much more pleasurable !
i love the apple products .
as usual at customer service center , she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague ( i could see them ) .
i will be returning it and switching brands when i get to best buy .
so i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer
i know apples are more expensive than pcs , but he thinks it is worth every penny .
that included the extra sony sonic stage software , the speakers and the subwoofer i got ( that was worth the money ) , the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer , the extended life battery and the docking port .
from the get-go , the m6809 was unsteady in its operation ;
purchased for development purposes , but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing , e-mail , etc .
you will not regret it , promise you !
no i am generous calling it slow .
steve jobs , probably needs help and donations , and can not afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby .
it is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices , and usb devices are recognized almost instantly .
i can actually get work done with this mac , and not fight with it like my tired old pc laptop .
not to mention , the battery life is absolutely amazing .
toshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it .
i spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person !
it is a big big , but since it has a 18.4 " screen what would you expect !
when i got this laptop in 2007 to help me with school , i had a hard time from beginning .
once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts .
i love the mac so much better than my work pc !
please make these !
may be better for the occasional web surfer .
no complaints with their desktop , and maybe because it just sits on your desktop , and you do n't carry it around , which could jar the hard drive , or the motherboard .
i first purchased this dell model " 1764 " on april 6 , 201
it was returned on the third day i owned it .
took it back as it was defective .
i bought it for really cheap also and it 's amazing .
the macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance .
the sound was crappy even when you turn up the volume still the same results .
i saw this one , and i have the most difficult time trying to use them , they 've made great dust collectors , i hate putting this computer down
after about a week i finally got it back and was told that the motherboard had failed and so they installed a new motherboard .
i have had to send in my laptop three times to get it fixed .
will not buy another toshiba , this is my second , not happy w / either .
it would n't fit in most 17-inch bags .
with the macbook pro it comes with free security software to protect it from viruses and other intrusive things from downloads and internet surfing or emails .
also , macbooks come with much more features which are so cool !
you may just lose 1 customer for now .
would like more trendy , high tech features .
if you really want a bang-up system and do n't need to run windows applications , go with an apple ;
( the sata controller is the motherboard chip that lets the cpu talk to the hard drive . )
summary : hp knew they were shipping out bad bios and did nothing proactive to resolve it .
the last new mac i bought was in 1998 .
the aluminum body sure makes it stand out .
my trackpad is not working .
i got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime i touched the lid , ( mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed ) but i suffered thru it and would constantly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out .
also i typed faster then then letters would show and it got to be realy annoying .
it seems they could have updated xp and done without creating vista .
the so called laptop runs to slow and i hate it !
did n't work when shipped from walmart.com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop ( same make/model ) .
one drawback , i wish the keys were backlit .
this is my second macbook .
all apple associates are always willing to help you out with anything , no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed .
two of the times was in one month .
this computer was awful !
plus stylish .
the wheel that turns the volume up and down does n't work in real time .
the next time i had an issue my lightscribe would n't work .
he said quite a number of people had encountered this problem and said it is a common issue .
very annoying .
i also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen .
getting the apple care plan is a must .
with no problems , i 'm happy with this purchase because i saved money compared to buying it anywhere else .
this computer is a little more expensive than any pc but it will last you longer and it worth every penny .
the only problem is a lack of screen resolutions !
it is lightweight and the perfect size to carry to class .
the toshiba mini notebook , model nb 305-n410bl , is a great little computer .
i custom ordered the machine from hp and could not understand the techie due to his accent .
it was shooting sparks !
she ca n't tell the difference between it and her regular desktop system .
i 've had friends with acers who seem to have had similar or exact same problems .
i was happy with my purchase of a toshiba satellite l305d-s5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the toshiba warranty .
the price is 200 dollars down .
the dell inspiron is fast and has a number pad on the keyboard , which i miss on my apple laptops .
taking it back to best buy i found that a tiny plastic piece inside had broken ( manuf issue ) .
they were able to set-up with laptops themselves within a few minutes .
in november my computer messed up entirely and would n't power on after installing a windows update , i had to have my hd flashed and lost everything on it , including my school assignments and irreplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things , when this update was installed for some reason i was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history .
after numerous calls to applecare tech support , i was directed to send in my computer ;
the cons are more annoyances that can be lived with .
the cool thing about this is anyone can use it .
in my line of work , i often have to take work home , and this makes it so easy .
i 'm having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying $ 176 every 3 months just is n't worth it ( that 's about how long the port seems to last ) .
beta had better quality , but vhs became the industry standard .
it was a great deal after all .
- when battery life went to 4 hours or less , took it to the machouse amsterdam for repair ( 26th of august ) .
the only issue came when i tried scanning to the mac .
the layout of the macbook is horrible and confusing ;
this worked just fine .
i have three words : piece of junk !
the book is useless .
solution : it turned out to be pretty simple .
the only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2.0 hrs when not plugged in .
excellent speed for processing data .
our apple 13.3 macbook pro notebook computer ( z0j80001 ) notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking .
my iphone synced right up just like a person would expect , unlike the pcs in our lives .
returned laptop for a 3rd repair and it came back with previous problems fixed ( except for speaker grill ) but the unit started locking up during use and eventually would not operate at all .
the mouse is a little bit different than what you 're used to though - it has one big flat panel and one full bar ( instead of two separate ones ) to click with - but you get used to it quite quickly .
the best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once , it never slows down .
boot-up slowed significantly after all windows updates were installed .
i 'm done with windoze computers .
i was so happy with my new mac .
cheaper than buying it @ apple too !
i went to toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it .
my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that does n't require a dedicated video card .
i use this for my tutoring business , and since i 'm always bouncing from student to student , it is ideal for portability and battery life ( yes , it gets the 8 hours as advertised ! ) .
the battery was completely dead , in fact it had grown about a quarter inch thick lump on the underside .
i returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund .
i gave it to my daughter because i just hated the screen , hated that it had no cd drive to at least play cd 's when i wanted to listen to music and do schoolwork .
it 's fun to take to a bookstore , sit in the coffee shop area , sign in to wifi and look up book reviews of books i might buy .
do n't waste their money , save it and but a mac .
it 's shiny and it 's pretty .
but sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough ( this could be because im used to my lenovo 10 tablet now ) plus this is a great size if i want to unplug the external keyboard , mouse , and monitor to take it with me when i take photos and video .
i ' ts nice to have the higher-end laptops , but this fits my budget and the features i need .
i work on a pc at home and have used pc all through college .
more times that not the screen pops up saying i have a bad internet connection , or the page ca n't be displayed .
i thought the price was great for the specs .
it has had some problems .
it would not let me connect to my wifi system where i lived .
when it broke i wanted another acer and chose the v5 .
it 's super fast and a great value for the price !
no machine has come remotely close to causing as many problems .
strong performance in this device makes use of fun and a strong sense of the era of speed this device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very useful for designers .
i bought this mac in order to replace my old dell laptop .
even though it is much more expensive than many pc laptops , it is worth the price .
thank you so much for the great item .
i have to wonder why amazon is even selling this dinosaur .
my one complaint with this laptop is that i 've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in .
" i 've had it now about 2 months and absolutely love it .
so needless to day , i 'm not happy .
i wish iwork or ms office came with the mac , but ms office does n't even come with most pc laptops .
seems a much more economical way to get into apple than their other computers .
this computer gets very hot , before shutting down .
the speakers could have been better but it was n't a deal breaker ... this is a great little laptop ... love it !
although my model was listed as recalled , hp denied my claim .
my power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership , so it was covered by the applecare warranty plan .
it 's a mac !!
nothing about it that i do n't love , apple always makes a great product .
it also does not have bluetooth .
luckily , dell said they would replace my laptop with a new one , but instead i got a refund and bought a mac .
my macbook pro is no exception .
i waited another month for approval and for them to " build " me a new laptop .
but i was completely wrong , this computer is unbelievable amazing and easy to use .
i 've installed to it additional ssd and 16gb ram .
before i got my macbook , i owned a dell laptop .
i pondered very long over this decision .
yeah , to you .
returned laptop for a 4th repair and it came back but now would lock up and randomly reboot frequently making the laptop unusable .
so noise is reduced at least 50 % and the heat is much better , now it does n't feel hot but warm .
it works fine with our wireless and they 've had not problems .
this laptop looks great on the surface : 17 " inch screen , good price-point , nice appearance , boots up quickly , runs fast etc .
10/10 five stars would recommend .
it discharges too quickly .
i was a little worry at first because i do n't have a lot of experience with os.x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows .
a scratch on a $ 1,500 macbook is unforgivable .
i realize that not every unit has this issue , but the ones that do can not be repaired .
my mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary .
it super shiny , so you can see the fingerprints easily .
this machine is amazing .
anyways i bought this two months ago and when i first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporarily in save zone .
drivers updated ok but the bios update froze the system up and the computer shut down .
lightweight and the screen is beautiful !
in due course , i 'll remove the hard disc from this new macbook pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash .
ok , this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by apple .
my husband got me this for chrismas after getting me a very expensive laptop that did not work after 2 days .
frustrated i hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time .
very nice so far .
( if you ever see the spinning beachball come up when you think it should n't , check the " activity monitor " app to see if the disk throughput has temporarily dropped to zero .
it has been nothing but trouble from the time we bought it .
the screen is nice and the images comes very clear , the keyboard and the fit just feels right .
sorry toshiba , but 1st impressions do count for something .
i have owned many computers and laptops .
the case is now slightly larger than the previous generation , but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size .
the apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you : )
i expected so as it 's an apple product , but i was glad to see my expectations exceeded , this is the laptop to buy right now .
emachines says they 're waiting for a part and refuses to replace entire unit .
while the keyboard itself is alright , the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons .
thank god for " ctrl z " bottom line , i 've been using laptops since the mid 90s and probably the majority of brands out there .
i always swore by pcs and would never consider a mac .
also , i have alot of trouble with it getting very hot , and not even sitting on anything to make it hot .
not a scratch or mark on it .
let me tell you , this machine is great .
it also came with a built it web cam which is great because i can see an communicate with my family members back home .
i stayed up half the night enjoying my new macbook pro .
i had a macbook notebook , and it had absolutely no protection from viruses , spyware , malware , etc .
if this would be your first mac purchase then i would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between mac and pc 's .
but i did n't want to spend another thousand on a laptop since my work already provides me with a pc .
the macbook pro is very sturdy and versatile .
i am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook , it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop .
being a pc user for many years to switch to a mac i will not go back .
i have no problems yet on my mac so far , and hope it stays like that .
taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase
the new macbook is light-years ahead of my old white plastic macbook circa 2006 .
oh my goodness - i am not a happy camper .
i only used it to browse the internet and and i dont know how many times it has spontaneously shut down and it is just a blank screen now .
the programs that come standard with the leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics .
they sent it off and within 2 weeks i had it back good as new .
what i 'd like is for the laptop to run well without having to purchase additional memory .
do not buy it !
ease of use is just one of the benefits i love about my mac .
i feel that enough people have macs these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be .
i did swap out the hard drive for a samsung 830 ssd which i highly recommend .
it is very easy for anyone to use an apple and specially the macbook pro notebook .
the worst a mac ever did to me was freeze up .
nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan .
it did everything we expected !
the system it comes with does not work properly , so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all .
the laptop is relatively simple to use , though i bought macs for dummies , which is well worth $ 2
still under warrenty so called toshiba , no help at all .
again in february my computer completely failed to the point that it could not load windows so i contacted acer to get it fixed thru my warrenty and it took about 3 days fighting on the phone with agents and it seemed as though none of them spoke english .
" then i proceed to tell her that i checked out other retail stores that carry the netbook and it was n't like that .
- i propose that they can just swap the hard drives .
so when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand .
the awesomest of the awesomest .
perfect -- thanks so .
anyway , in early july of this year , the dvd burner stopped working , and the computer stared having issues with power supply .
the mcbook pro notebook will make it easy for you to write and read your emails at blazing speeds .
without a doubt , the * design * of this laptop is fantastic .
the os is great .
it was fast , and it was " different " .
as an owner of a toshiba satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy .
this device has met my expectations and i 'm sure it will meet yours .
the genius at the apple store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure .
i have had another mac , but it got slow due to an older operating system .
dells are ok , hps are n't that good , but macs are fantastic .
again , the same problem , the right speaker did not work .
it is meant to be portable .
there are no gold key numbers to install programs , you must use the serial numbers that it does not accept and then things are limited as far a working because they are only good for a short time .
i can have both osx and windows xp running at the same time !
it 's all a bit magical .
had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in .
i ' have had it for about a 1-1/2 and yes i have had an issue with it one month out of warranty .
i love this laptop , and use it everyday to do something , and never lets me down .
one drawback i noticed was sound quality via usb .
the macbook rarely requires a hard reboot .
i 've already recommended this laptop to a friend who eye 'd the computer when i took it out of my bag .
i edit and burn to dvd a lot of video , so i obviously could not live with a non-functioning drive .
so , i 'm cooled on mac buys .
we researched and found the best price at macconnection .
it all just makes sense .
they break down just as often as pcs do , and the only reason they do n't get viruses , is because no one makes viruses for them , they 're not better in any way , they are worse , try finding virus protection programs for a mac , they do n't exist .
i will not be using that slot again .
one year of trying to fix the computer by myself , with help of friends , and even help from computer experts i have given up on trying to fix it .
the other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes , the most common being a corrupted version of appleworks which can render the browser useless .
of course , i also have several great software packages that came for free including iwork , garageband , and imovie .
apple and guess what , you have to send the whole laptop in , too bad , so sad
i bought it to be able to dedicate a small , portable laptop to my writing and was surprised to learn that i needed to buy a word processing program to do so .
they are not .
i have used different laptops in the past and i have to rate this one way above the rest .
do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop .
i absolutely love my mac !
overall i am very satisfied with the purchase .
you pay for what you get for .
this is no exception .
and i would recommend this to anyone looking for a new laptop .
from the start , when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine .
previous laptops were pc 's , still have them , but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system .
it has spent more time in repair shops than i can possibly recount here .
it 's just a great toy to have around .
the mac mini , wireless keyboard / mouse and a hdmi cable is all i need to get some real work done .
this is why i purchased a brand new laptop in the first place so it would n't have any problems .
i believe with apple - you get what you pay for .
when you look at the specs on apple products in comparison to a dell or a hp , yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost .
easy to install also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to configure for adsl cable or wifi .
very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent ...
i just fell in love with this thing .
i left the place angrily .
this is a review of windows vista system .
i constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed .
once you go mac , you ca n't go back !
it has a .1 ghz faster processor and a stock 500gb hard drive .
both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary product key .
we both recently got new laptops .
seems to me that 's the best way to get apple 's attention .
while most people say that pcs hold functionality and value and macs are just pretty to look at , i think there 's something to be said about the simplicity of macs .
the biggest problem is that the box had no instructions in it .
i started having problems with it within the first month .
the battery holds up well , it 's built very solidly , and runs fast .
the one thing that apple does right is computers .
i sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it .
for me , keys were starting to get stuck and would n't type very well .
another thing i might add is the battery life is excellent .
as of a couple weeks ago the middle portion of the laptop from top to bottom , , , about 4 inches across is hardly visible .
finally , the biggest problem has been tech support .
i am taking back today .
this computer does everything i need it to do for school and more .
learning all of the keyboard shortcuts only took a few minutes to get used to as some of the shortcuts are the same on windows machines .
after doing cad work all day at work , using a higher end pc , i could n't come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer .
the only thing i do n't understand is that the resolution of the screen is n't high enough for some pages , such as yahoo!mail .
she said wal mart rants and raves abouy carring dell because it 's a big name but they are a piece of garbage .
i honestly love my mac , thats why i am a self proclaimed mac addict .
and toshiba is a quality supplier .
the flaws are , this computer is not for computer gamers because of the os x .
i only wish this mac had a cd/dvd player built in .
being a tech savvy , apple - product loving person , i 'm glad i finally got the macbook pro !
excellent led monitor and well equipped .
he has replaced his hard drive twice and ( of course ) has had to pay for antivirus software every year .
:) in the past four years i 've had it i have never once gotten a virus .
i also bought one for my wife , and 3 for my office .
the port is secured to motherboard so when this happens you ca n't see the plug at all , it 's just gone .
the only thing i miss is that my old alienware laptop had backlit keys .
i 'm not exaggerating when i say this computer is perfect ... it is !!
we love the size of the screen , although it is still lightweight and very easy to tote around .
this laptop serves all my needs .
the " abuse " is that i pushed the power plug in too hard .
unfortunately , it runs xp and microsoft is dropping support next april .
just what the doctor ordered .
it is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an alienware gaming machine .
suffice it to say , my macbook pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed .
people know what they are talking about and they have pride in the product that they are selling .
so i called compaq , and after being on the phone for 3 hours , i finally got a replacement which i should n't have had a problem getting since it was under warranty .
also , i have had a lot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines .
after paying several hundred dollars for this service , it is frustrating that you can not get help after hours .
three , the mac book has advantages over pcs ' with linux based os there is very ' few problems with system performance when it comes to a mac .
it was over rated !
my only complaint is the total lack of instructions that come with the mac mini .
i will have to say that i love my macbook pro !
it rarely works and when it does it 's incredibly slow .
overall it 's an amazing product , 5 stars !
everything is falling apart internally and externally .
still trying to learn how to use it .
the machine has a bluray player the book has no mention of it or how to connect it to your hdtv .
from the build quality to the performance , everything about it has been sub-par from what i would have expected from apple .
could n't have asked for more !
comfortable to use light easy to transport .
the program came with the computer and works beautifully .
* 6th week * - they are not responding to my emails asking when they expect to dispatch the new unit ...
im very happy with this computer !
toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another , and i am not kidding you , i called different hours of the day and you 'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again , since they make it sound like they do n't have your history list of your calls right in front of them .
is this partially due to the fact that it is running windows vista ?
this is a great value for the money .
how toshiba handles the repair seems to vary , some folks indicate that they were charged for even an intial fix , others had the repair done 5 times .
i was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that i was looking for .
the overall build quality of the unit is excellent and she 'd recommend it to anyone else looking for a netbook .
am very glad i bought it , great netbook , low price .
windows 7 starter is terrific ( no you ca n't change the background ) but i do n't need to , i use it just for school work .
they went through asking me open up various components , taking battery out , hard disk apart , and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it .
the apple systems are over priced luxurys that are n't worth what they are being charged for , this model 's specifications are far from being impressive and they only thing you get out of this is the apple name .
it makes a great gift .
update : two years after buying this laptop , i am now the proud owner of a lemon .
put a ssd and use a 21 " led screen , this set up is silky smooth !
apple " help " is a mixed bag .
also ... - excellent operating system - size and weight for optimal mobility - excellent durability of the battery - the functions provided by the trackpad is unmatched by any other brand -
go for it !
the battery life also does n't keep up with the claim but still i think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack .
i 'm overall pleased with the interface and the portability of this product .
screen is crystal clear , yes it 's small - but it 's a netbook !
the difference is phenomenal .
but there 's this application called boot camp which allows you to add another os x like windows .
it really is perfect for work and play .
eventually my battery would n't charge , so unless i had it plugged in it would n't even power on .
i still see the benefits of a pc when i do not know how to do something on my mac .
i still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to !
so of course this one came through with the awesomeness !
also stunning colors and speedy
screen is awesome , battery life is good .
and that probably explains why i 've already had my sata controller go bad within a year of buying it .
and that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed .
winters is on it 's way and i imagine it will be cozy .
no luck , although i waited for hours on the phone-visited machouse , they stated the their call center is down due to too many phone calls ( difficult to believe ) .
i had the same reasons as most pc users : the price , the overbearing restrictions of osx and lack of support for games .
apple did a great job .
i ordered four d620 laptops .
they were great in handling this problem , and i 'm looking forward in purchasing additonal products from them in the future .
this is the third macbook pro in our family .
i got this at an amazing price from amazon and it arrived just in time .
currently if i use the laptop i ca n't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs .
it is extremely fast and very compact .
what can i say .
that day !
good keyboard , long battery life , largest hard drive and windows 7 .
bought it to use mostly for online classes .
enough said .
this item is a beautiful piece , it works well , it is easy to carry and handle .
i took 3-4 years researching brands and prices of laptops .
his was worth $ 36 .
so far so good with this laptop .
my husband uses it mostly for games , email and music .
i have never had any issues or problems with my macbook pro so far , and it is still as fast as it was when i first bought it .
you 'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them .
the computer is a dream come true .
this netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop ( my wife and i have another laptop ) , or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks .
my review mainly talks about the difference i have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 mac book pro .
they have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and i 'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular .
posted nov 8 , 2010 - two weeks ago i bought this notebook .
i do everything on this computer - check email , facebook , shop , check blogs , write papers , listen to music , and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv .
no hassle and no complaints .
i am loyal to apple .
i loved it then , but unfortunately it was before the days of wireless internet .
it was kind of a rebellion against pc in fact , and i am certainly glad i did .
i have had it 9 months and it is already a $ 250 loss .
completely worth every single penny dime and nickel .
it is so simple to use , i use it more than my desktop .
the macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box , all the functions works great .
and if you are a game player it works with world of warcraft wonderfully .
first it burned or fused the power adapter plug .
it want take it , it keep saying error .
in addition , all the design tools on pages and keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations .
i had static in the output , and i had to reduce the sound output quality to " fm " as opposed to the default " cd .
incredible graphics and brilliant colors .
the guy then said that if i insist on having the hinge tightened , they can do it for me but i have to accept the condition after the " repair " .
i really do n't like it , but i am stuck .
i recommend for word processing and internet users .
ive never had a problem with it !
however , they were kind enough to send a replacement free of charge .
the feel of this is better than the toshiba , too .
its fast , has high definition quality in the videos .
but when i received my replacement , i made both recovery dvds ( 4 ) , and a driver/application dvd .
much faster than my old windows laptop that died on me .
we also use paralles so we can run virtual machines of windows xp professional , windows 7 home premium , windows server enterprise 2003 , and windows server 2008 enterprise .
my macbook is so much better looking and so thin !
i was originally concerned that i could n't view work i had done in college on my mac because of the pc formatting , but i was even more thrilled to learn of programs like ilife and iwork that allow you to convert your pc documents into readable files on macs .
being a pc user my whole life ....
the programs are great , like iphoto ( love the editing capabilities ) , imail ( which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad ) , imovie , etc .
this was an update from an early macbook pro .
it still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there .
the macbook pro is a great product which can meet the needs of the average consumer .
i 'm learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages .
my problem was with dell customer service .
he ca n't stand it .
i am going to go back and return at store i bought from !
turns out this is a common problem .
to those thinking about switching , do it and do not look back !
long story short , since i experience so many problems with my laptop every since i bought it from day one , i did n't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what i pay for a crappy laptop , but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year , they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services , they finally gave in .
its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action .
2 . the wireless card is low quality .
if you want more information on macs i suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications .
spent 2 hours on phone with hp technical support .
all in all , a very disappointing experience except that i learned how good the geek squad is and also customer service .
they sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer , they paid postage and whatnot , but when i got my computer back it still was n't running right , and now my cd drive was n't reading anything !
however , the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary ( unless you 're gaming ) .
their products , including the mbp , are beautiful , sleek and clever .
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is .
i got this laptop on black friday .
but while this is one big advantage ( as you may know from the company s recent commercials ) there are other things to consider before going with apple .
i have been a pc user since middle school , but in my mid twenties i decided to convert to the dark side , or should i say the brighter side of life .
and then , a guy came out to serve me instead .
when i got it , i immediately noticed that it was quite heavy and thick and not really attractive .
i know that everyone thinks macs are overpriced and overrated , but once you get past the initial expense you 'll find that they 're worth every penny ( besides , there 's always the financing plan that best buy offers ) .
it is easy to use , good quality and good price .
we paid for the three year warranty and the extended warranty after that one ended as well .
it meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling .
but then , something goes wrong .
i could not handle it one hand like i can the replacement computer i purchased .
we were pc users .
it was n't worth it .
when the buyer returned it wal mart just boxed it , taped it shut resold it as new .
i hate it !
it came alot faster than i thought it would have which was really exciting .
3d rendering slows it down considerably .
they are about the same size keys .
i 'm very disappointed in dell .
this computer is absolutely amazing !!!
the battery life seems to be very good , and have had no issues with it .
for some odd reasons the computer does n't recognize the operation system .
it 's ok but does n't have a disk drive which i did n't know until after i bought it .
i did add a ssd drive and memory
the battery life was shorter than expected .
the black model also has a very nice seamless appearance - one of the better looking notebooks i 've seen .
would highly recommend this netbook though .
i have recently converted back to a mac and i could n't be happier !
i would really recommend to any person out there to get this laptop cause its really worth it .
boot time is super fast , around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .
i have other computers that get strong signals that do n't drop in places that this " net " book loses its signal .
do not purchase this laptop .
those things are very important - vital even !
the i5 blows my desktop out of the water when it comes to rendering videos .
it 's the mid 2012 version .
it has all the expected features and more + plus a wide screen and more than roomy keyboard .
if the number of patrons in the apple store are any indication , hp and other pc manufacturers need to take note .
my mac is much more efficient than a pc so it does not need the extra bells and whistles to compete .
there is no need to open a program first and the click open or import .
i need graphic power to run my adobe creative apps efficiently .
super light , super sexy and everything just works .
the pictures are clear as can be .
i got what i paid for .
pc users use the powerpoint program for slide-show presentation and mac users utilize keynote .
me and my boyfriend bought the gateway nv78 in nov of 09 .
all the above aside this machine rocks !
words can not express how much i love my new mac .
the software is amazing .
these new problems were the final straws ;
well , maybe more like week one .
this system is not worth the money or trouble trying to get it fix .
now , the next issue i had freaked me out .
but to be honest , the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think i ll buy a pc next time .
yet , hp wo n't do anything about the problem .
congratulations asus for creating one big piece of dump which is my laptop .
this one , in my opinion , might be a lemon !
it was a huge monstrosity of a laptop !
it looks and feels solid , with a flawless finish .
seriously considering a larger laptop to replace the dell
i returned it to best buy on the ninteenth of april .
has all the other features i wanted including a vga port , hdmi , ethernet and 3 usb ports .
* 5 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - apple offers to send replacement after they receive the old computer .
the apple care has never failed me , and i expect it to be the same for this computer as well .
for the same price , you get a lot more in the asus .... 1920x1080 res .
i am now frustrated that i still have to use my work issued windows laptop !
i do n't like this company nor the toshiba brand , and i 'll never buy another one because i 've put more into it then it is worth .
its as advertised on here .... . it works great and is not a waste of money !
it is blazing fast !
i love the easy to see screen , and it works well for work , personal or just play .
skype is just so dang cool with this machine too .
a second problem involves the battery which is advertised as having a storage life of 11 hours but when fully charged shows only 7 hours of service .
they 're absolutely useless , unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall .
or the cursor would show up some place else .
after sending out documents via email and having recipients tell me they could not open the documents or they came through as gibberish , i broke down and spent another $ 100 to get microsoft word for mac .
i use the computer to basically check emails , surf the web , print coupons and for my college papers .
i bought my acer aspire custom made in june 2008 .
i have had a black macbook since 2007 .
i had the computer for a full year and it was a new computer .
now i could get myself a cheap computer , that will probably work a whole lot better !
but if you 're willing to pay another 200 dollar for a windows disc .
a month or so ago , the freaking motherboard just died .
wasted me at least 8 hours of installation time .
its still going .
i would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had windows 8
i already have a hp laptop i bought last year that 's standard size .
the screen is bright and clear , the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice .
once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed windows 8 set-up you may feel frustrated .
i was really happy because it is a much better price on amazon.com than it was in the mac store .
i think this is about as good as it gets at anything close to this price point .
not too much " junk " software to remove .
garageband is easy to work with , like all the other apple applications i 've had experience with .
i am using the external speaker - sound is good .
my toshiba did not have sound on everything , just certain things .
there is no number pad to the right of the keyboard which is a bummer .
it is everything i 'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint , but somehow a bit more sturdy .
they offer the best warranty in the business , and do n't 3rd party it out like toshiba .
the nortons virus scan is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year .
my husband purchased a laptop at the same time for about $ 300 less ( he got a pc ) .
some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software , but there is no guarantee .
i recently purchased the mini and absolutely love it !
i have loved this since i took it out of the box .
has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device .
it was heavy , bulky , and hard to carry because of the size .
there 's literally no way to make it sing with vista .
during that time , i had to send it back 3 times .
overall , still a very nice machine .
i managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me .
came fully loaded - good .
it runs perfectly .
i 'm very impressed .
but with a way bigger screen , and is able to connect to an hdmi .
i am forever changed and will no longer buy a windows based machine for personal use .
it turned out it 's not really a problem to have a mac .
maybe not the cutting edge ( satellite l455d ) but it is a workhorse .
i feel that it was poorly put together , because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it .
the durability of the laptop will make it worth the money .
good computer and fast .
after looking at all the pros and cons , i decided on the macbook pro .
- they say it will take " up to two weeks " .
and at one point , they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when i upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop ( i bought the memory stick they recomended ) .
if so , you may be having similar problems .
with the softwares supporting the use of other os makes it much better .
very good quality and well made .
all the yada-yada .
the battery life was supposed to be 6 hours , but even if i ran off the battery with the high efficiency setting the battery would only last me on average about 2.5 to 3 hours .
at first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and i send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later i then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now i have to send it back again to get it fixed again .
i find myself using the 10-key more than i thought i would .
it works exactly like it did the day i took it out of the box .
the computer was shipped to their repair depot on june 24 and returned on july 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned .
who makes a laptop that ca n't rest on your lap ?
despite the inconvenient weight , i opted for the 12 cell battery .
small screen somewhat limiting but great for travel .
thus , when you carry it at a slanted angle , the screen will " topple " or " slide " down , if you understand what i mean .
i ca n't begin to say how disappointed i am .
i had to pay $ 100 for a universal charger for this cheap $ 300 laptop .
comes with imovie ;
do not buy you will be disappointed .
it does not even have the software to play a dvd now .
i can render avchd movies with little effort , which was a problem for most pc 's unless you had a quad core i7 .
i asked many people , search on the net and also read reviews here in best buy .
i had gotten this model for $ 1199.00 on my state 's tax-free weekend and had a $ 100 off coupon for a macbook at the local bestbuy !
it 's so useable and responsive .
clearly , there is something wrong with the product and lg did n't take up the responsibility .
i had meant to purchase the nb205 and bought this one by accident ( long story ) .
windows vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service .
if you do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just buy the case and be happy , plus it looks nice , i bought the white one from best buy .
i paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me .
we did not even have it a year .
but , mac makes the switch from pc to mac easy .
i did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements , but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before i purchased .
quality display i was surprised with the performance and quality of this hp laptop .
about 1/2 of the sites i need to visit because of my work contain some type of flash .
soft touch , anodized aluminum with laser cut precision and no flaws .
then it ceased charging at all .
the new operating system makes this computer into a super ipad .
i previously owned a toshiba and it only lasted about 2 years .
( no problem with the ordering or shipping by the way .
i have been very pleased with the performance of this laptop .
its a dog plain and simple .
my only other complaint is that it gets really hot .
a tip for people looking into this computer : do not buy it save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .
the netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me .
the reality was , it heated up very quickly , and took way too long to do simple things , like opening my documents folder .
this laptop is a great price and has a sleek look .
the screen brightness automatically adjusts .
i am first time mac buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the mac offers .
i had to return it for a replacement .
i enjoy having apple products .
no laptop is perfect , but sometimes you just find a computer that works for you .
i let my friend borrow it , and she knows nothing about computers , and she used it with ease .
i was said it 's video card .
the material this pro is made out of seems a lot nicer than any pc specs : like i said this performs a lot better than any computer i 've had in the past .
i respond that i do not have the old computer and this way i would lose the data on my hard drive .
) only to get another " hp/compaq " piece of crap .
you will love this macbook if you choose to buy it .
also it is light weight compared to others .
what a waste .
it is very easy to type on and feels great - besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted .
they are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site .
so glad i decided to upgrade !
wifi capability , disk drive and multiple usb ports to connect scale and printers was all that was required .
i think part of the problem with this computer is vista , yet i know vista is n't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my acer and it also has vista ( i should have waited the few months to get the next operating system ) .
it is so much easier to use
i have owned many different brands of laptops in my life .
the design is awesome , quality is unprecedented .
for example , when my husband turns the light out while i 'm on the computer .
my macbook was worth ( after 3 years of use ! ) $ 375 .
games being the main issue .
there is no cd drive on the computer , which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd .
supplied software : the software that comes with this machine is greatly welcomed compared to what windows comes with .
i am constantly trying to uninstall programs , clean cookies , and delete unused files .
it is in the best condition and has a really high quality .
very very highly recommended .
after 4 days , being denied 6 times and told off once , i managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt .
every single one we 've gotten we 've had problems with .
a month later , we reinstall the os ( vista ) .
unfortunately , apple 's quality has continued to slide .
i wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month .
apple no longer includes idvd with the computer and furthermore , apple does n't even offer it anymore !
buy this if you like being tortured , teased , frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old mac .
the hardware problems have been so bad , i ca n't wait till it completely dies in 3 years , tops !
this is a great laptop and i would recommend it to anyone .
this computer was so challenging to carry and handle .
i got the macbook and he got a macbook pro .
this computer was awful , i would never recomend it to another person .
its seen in movies , sitcoms , prominent important people carry and use them and they are great !
i decided to buy a few notebooks for my nephews for xmas .
on start up it asks endless questions just so itune can sell you more of their products .
pc never worked right even after bios fixed .
so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop .
as for the laptop , this is our 3rd apple computer in the past 2 years .
i also purchased office max 's " max assurance " with the " no lemon " clause .
i was given a mac as a birthday present and could n't be happier with it 3 years later .
the internet can be an scary place its up to you on what you do with it .
theres also idvd , a program dedicated to putting all your favorite media together - photos , recordings , video projects into one program so that you can create the perfect memoir for your parents , family , siblings , and any other person important in your life that there may be .
i love everything about it .
everything was up and running within 15 minutes of unboxing .
i contacted hp about this situation and was given excuses , without results .
i am most impressed with the programming , including the iphoto .
its perfect , not much heavy .
this machine delivers .
this machine was a horrible experience .
i wish it had a webcam though , then it would be perfect !
tons of bloatware and junk programs .
this machine is flawless , fast , and classy .
numerous problems over the next 3 weeks until i got the blue screen of death and had to send the pc back to hp .
i switched to this because i wanted something different , even though i miss windows .
it was still working , but there was nothing on the screen .
i 've already upgraded o mavericks and i am impressed with everything about this computer .
i have been a mac user since the mid 90s .
both computers started acting extremely slow within the first year of owning them .
it runs very quiet too which is a plus .
this version of macbook pro runs on a third-generation cpu ( " ivy bridge " ) , not the latest fourth-generation haswell cpu the 2013 version has .
no , they do n't even support their own bios and it " could be a problem with the bios " how can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity ??!!
the graphics are great .
i love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new toshiba works great on both !
all in all great item highly recommend it .
after they found no other way , they told me to courier it to them ( since they do n't allow the use of the post office ) at my expense , and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it would n't be covered .
dell is a decently made pc .
i would recommend this acer to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school .
charger seems large for this class of computer .
i 'm using this computer for word processing , web browsing , some gaming , and i 'm learning programming .
pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were .
great wifi too .
sure hope best buy will replace it asap .
not enough time for me to give it 5 stars !
after much effort and 10 days asus replaced it the wifi is very weak .
we are addicted to the mac .
the battery is really long .
also , if you need to talk to a representative at microsoft , there is a charge , which i believe is robbery , since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system , which most people would have went with xp if they could .
additional caveat : the base installation comes with some toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user 's liking .
i am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when i got back in town .
there also seemed to be a problem with the hard disc as certain times windows loads but claims to not be able to find any drivers or files .
at first !
even though i had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty .
this is a great little computer for the price .
i 'm pretty sure when i bought it , my bank account went ' ouch !
this is my second mac book pro .
the 4 usb ports are nice , but the two on the side only work now and then .
i had to buy a wireless mouse to go with it , as i am old school and hate the pad , but knew that before i bought it , now it works great , need to get adjusted to the key board , as i am used to a bigger one and pounding .
this is the first apple product that i have purchased .
took several hours with customer support before i could even start the pc out of the box .
this is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine ;
i spent 2200 dollars on a " top of the line laptop " .
in fact i still use many legacy programs ( appleworks , filemaker pro , quicken , photoshop etc ) !
well , i had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my pc , but took the apple to the conference .
either way i 'm furious .
never had a single problem , and do n't have to worry about viruses .
it is very durable , i am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet .
i needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria .
was very much worth the price i paid .
macbook notebooks quickly die out because of their short battery life , as well as the many background programs that run without the user 's knowledge .
of course , i inspected the other netbooks and clearly their hinges are tighter and i even demonstrate the difference between my netbook and others .
garageband is more for the musicians , and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone , good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level .
it is always reliable , never bugged and responds well .
- they lost my laptop for a month
overall , i experienced a huge change in that my mac runs pretty fast compared to my old pc .
easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks .
this was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped .
i had to re-install windows within two weeks of the purchase and soon discovered cracks in the screen hinges .
it allows me to do everything i need from a computer and more .
it did not have all the features i expected it to have .
it was super easy to set up and is really easy to get used to .
that seemed to solve the problem , till i wrote an article with semicolons in it .
it 's perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc !
the paint wears off easily due to the keyboard being farther back than usual .
the people there just changed for me on the spot and i got a new arm piece and they did n't even request for a receipt .
i work in film editing and post production , so i need a laptop that not only has power , but memory and speed as well .
this laptop has only 2 usb ports , and they are both on the same side .
they removed them and returned the computer to me .
the old unibody macbook pro could fry an egg after a while .
i called apple and no solution .
it was quite easy .
the computer was two weeks late in delivery because hp forgot to complete the required import paperwork .
by this time i was regretting ever seeing this machine on the shelf !
i do n't use my laptop in a way though that needs a long battery life so it 's perfect for me .
i know some people complained about hdmi issues but they released a firmware patch to address that issue .
i wanted a computer that was quite , fast , and that had overall great performance .
mac computers automatically " defrag " each time you start your computer .
i paid about the same for my toshiba as i did for the compaq a few years back .
i have only had pcs with windows before so this takes a little getting use to .
it is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not .
the price was very good , and the product is top quality .
but i needed a laptop for school use .
i have used pc 's and converting to this macbook pro was easy .
this comes in very handy for me as an educator .
i would say that 85 % of the design industry is mac for good reason .
i 'm very happy with this machine !
the mouse is way way way too sensitive .
i am a full mac convert now .
memory is upgradable .
i bought this lap top and the charge time dose n't last as long as they say it will more like 2 hours
thanks for great service and shipping !
i guess he was the technical person .
having a mac certainly makes life easier .
speaking of the browser , it too has problems .
it is the easiest computer i have ever used
- when i started worrying for not hearing anything from them , i tried to call .
they really do have the worlds very worst repair service .
i 've had it for about 2 months now and found no issues with software or updates .
if that is the case for you , i would suggest a pull-behind solution when looking at cases .
it is easy to use and lightweight .
enjoy your sit down
i contacted acer and they are giving me free recovery dvds , so do n't go and pay for them , just ask for them and they should give them to you .
not super fancy , but not super expensive either .
i thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer would n't go onto our wireless network and i would n't have the same problems because it was updated .
buy it , love it , and i promise you wo n't regret it .
i waited and waited and no laptop .
but reasons we chose this apple computer .
i have recommended this laptop to everyone i know who is buying one .
i tried out another mac for a few months before buying this one and it is a great machine .
this is the first time for me to use a mac and i 'm really happy with the move .
so then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back , but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened , and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair ( the price of a new one ) .
this is what they told me : it heats up , and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops , and simply categorize them as portables .
it was a laugh too !
fine if you have a touch screen .
i had a usb connect but , i ca n't use it because it is not compatible .
this is another reason to like the mac .
where you click and hold and drag it picture , link , etc to where you want it .
it was very easy to just pick up and use -- it did not take long to get used to the mac os .
i have had nothing but problems since the day i took it out of the box !
it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one .
if you faintly come close to touching this thing while typing , all craziness may break loose .
the new mbp offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months .
this computer literally takes about five minutes to start up and to be able to use without it crawling and i do mean crawling .
i definitely suggest getting an extended warranty , you will probably need it !
made interneting ( part of my business ) very difficult to maintain .
the mac book pro performs flawlessly .
no cd rom in the new version there 's no way i 'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version .
the computer first started malfunctioning 3 months after purchasing it .
i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck .
recommended to people as their first laptop .
i 'm pretty sure it 's not newegg 's fault but when you turn on a computer you just bought you want it to at least get to desktop .
this laptop is great for work and doing my pictures .
after talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate , i chose the macbook pro over the white macbook .
but the biggest pain is that tech support is not available 24/7 .
so we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it did n't work .
i bought this last week , and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touch mouse stopped responding .
although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks .
i had a little problem adjusting to the small screen but works fine as long as i remember to carry my glasses .
most everything is fine with this machine : speed , capacity , build .
both my husband and i have this model toshiba .
this is quite smooth as well as heavy and can easily slip through the hands .
i love it and the change in lifestyle that came with it .
the mac snow leopard o/s is extremely easy to use , although very different than win xp , visa or win7 .
if a website ever freezes ( which is rare ) , its really easy to force quit .
and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare .
it was just one problem after another for me , and that 's reason we had forked out so much money was so we would n't have anything to worry about .
i give this laptop a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me .
the display on this computer is the best i 've seen in a very long time , the battery life is very long and very convienent .
* 4 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - annoyed at machouse amsterdam , decided to send complaint email to apple .
but i do n't see it as a problem .
if you are looking for a netbook pc do not buy from asus !!!
and the fact that apple is driving the 13 " rmbp with the intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered ( to me .
it was at my door in less than 24 hours .
i look forward to years of use , it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well .
i 've always used pc 's for work home and this is my first experience with a mac .
with all the programs that came with it , such as ilife and iwork , i was set from the very beginning .
the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one .
and windows 7 works like a charm .
granted , it 's still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops , my mac boots up noticeably quicker .
the unibody construction really does feel lot more solid than apple 's previous laptops .
i recommend the macbook pro if you want the best laptop on the market .
i respond that i do not have the old computer ...
pretty much made sense to get a mini .
i could n't afford a new mac , so i bought a pc instead .
finally decided to try a mac because there were too many choices of which pc 's to buy and everyone who had a mac said " buy a mac " .
bought from wal-mart , i believe that this laptop was a repaired item .
the tech store i purchased this from sent it back , , , , , eventually i got a new or repaired machine approximately 3 weeks later .
if you ask me , for this price it should be included .
i can throw anything at it ( and i do ) , pictures , video editing , schoolwork .
we do n't mind and you do n't matter .
5 months dead again .
but the arm velcro is torn after one use .
it 's a good fix , in my opinion .
an absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will .
only a few days after i received the computer back , the screen froze again .
the memory was gone and it was not able to be used .
:] it arrived so fast and customer service was great .
the customer service is terrific !!
the laptop was very easy to set up .
i was so excited when my dad said i could get a new laptop for my birthday .
so , you can imagine how unhappy i am with this item .
this is my second one and the same problem , bad video card unreliable overall , this will be my second time returning this laptop back to best buy .
it is quiet and a real joy to watch work .
* if you are looking for a good laptop , this is not it !
i love how easy every thing is to do on my apple products .
this macbook pro is fast , powerful , and runs super quiet and cool .
while there are occasions that my computer will freeze or will need to be manually shut down , this occurs far less frequently than on pc computers and laptops that i 've used .
it was always getting froze up .
i think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90 's .
the video card is great for media , and above average for gaming , but not a gamers first choice .
there were small problems with mac office .
not as fast as i would have expect for an i5 .
i had left my regular laptop at home and needed something to use while out of town .
it has everything you need to get the job done .
once again , i was told it was the suspicious power supply problem .
its sad because their commercials are great .
i know that asus is known for making motherboards , but this is the worst computer experience that i have ever had .
they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem .
they have not sent a new one nor called .
by week two , my laptop had overheated and was completely dead even though i did not use it too much .
nothing bad to say about it .
the keyboard is top notch .
i should have bought one a long time ago .
definitely worth spending the money on it .
one of them seems to have worked .
no tutorials on the display .
this netbook went bad on me after 3 days .
this thing is awesome , everything always works , everything is always easy to set up , everything is compatible , its literally everything i could ask for .
then just the other day , my left " mouse " button snapped !
that is how it is able to function better than any other pc .
it 's exactly what i wanted , and it has all the new features and whatnot .
, which apple does n't offer , is why i bought my macbook at best buy .
i was also informed that the components of the mac book were dirty .
you ca n't even get a satellite card which is why i bought to begin with .
simple to use , and great graphics .
i had purchased it from a major electronics store and took it to their service department to find out what the problem was .
it provides much more flexibility for connectivity .
have returned that laptop unused .
so i 'd pop them off to see what the problem was , well guess what ? the darn thing would n't go back on .
i finally made the leap after my gateway crapped out on me .
i bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since .
quality display i love hp , , it 's the only computer/printer we will buy .
it does n't heat up like my old laptop .
as it turns out , i just did n't know any better .
the resolution is even higher than any other laptop on the market .
after about another month i had to send it in again to acer for repairs .
* = webcam is a bit laggy , not the greatest .
and finally i realized that mac is the best .
i am paying apple to kill my self and my wallet .
