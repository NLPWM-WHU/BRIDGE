so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop .
supplied software : the software that comes with this machine is greatly welcomed compared to what windows comes with .
couldnt not use it .
dell is a decently made pc .
i was amazed at how fast the delivery was .
waited on getting this computer , but it has been a great change .
i love it !
i 'm pleased .
typing on the keyboard becomes uncomfortable after extended use due to the sharp edges that your wrists rest on .
the pro is a great product , i wish that the 13 inch models came with the intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge ( the edges hurt my wrists ) .
you may need to special order a bag .
while about 8 years ago , i hope that the quality has changed .
the laptop is relatively simple to use , though i bought macs for dummies , which is well worth $ 2
now the screen is going darker , darker , darker .
the neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing desktop icons .
windows 7 starter is terrific ( no you ca n't change the background ) but i do n't need to , i use it just for school work .
the rep did not even answer my question , i had to ask him , if he understood what i ask or if he spoke english because he did n't even try to acknowledge my question .
who could n't love a dvd burner , 80-gigabyte hd , and fairly new graphics chip ? as i soon discovered , though , there is a reason for which similarly-configured sony and toshiba machines cost more : they use higher-quality components that are faster , better-configured , and end up lasting a lot longer .
* 4 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - annoyed at machouse amsterdam , decided to send complaint email to apple .
now mainboard is broken , have to wait for a new one .
design : very durable .
otherwise , i love it !
not the day received .
overall , it 's ok .
the macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box , all the functions works great .
there were small problems with mac office .
it seemed to be a very nice laptop except i was not able to load my garmin gps software or microsoft office 2003 .
im very happy with this computer !
little short on ram but you get what you pay for .
it 's fast , it 's easy easy easy to set up , easy to hook to my wireless network .
while i mostly use it for email , internet and gaming , i 'm confident all other applications live up to the high standard i 've come to appreciate from mac laptops .
thank goodness for openoffice !
the battery life is excellent - 6-7 hours without charging .
my parents bought it for me as a graduation gift , and i 'm totally ( almost kind of maybe definitely ) obsessed with it .
this is my 3rd apple laptop and first macbook pro .
set up was easy .
the battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes .
i had the same reasons as most pc users : the price , the overbearing restrictions of osx and lack of support for games .
overall the computer is very easy to use , the screen is perfect , great computer , my daughter loves .
i ca n't say enough good for it !
numerous problems over the next 3 weeks until i got the blue screen of death and had to send the pc back to hp .
the reason why i choose apple macbook because of their design and the aluminum casing .
came with iphoto and garage band already loaded .
they say that this will invalidate the warranty on the hard drive ( i do n't really understand why but anyway ) .
as far as user type - i dabble in everything from games ( wow ) to photoshop , but nothing professionally .
that whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $ 175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $ 175 and it was fixed .
but see the macbook pro is different because it may have a huge price tag but it comes with the full software that you would actually need and most of it has free future updates .
the screen brightness automatically adjusts .
" then i proceed to tell her that i checked out other retail stores that carry the netbook and it was n't like that .
she said wal mart rants and raves abouy carring dell because it 's a big name but they are a piece of garbage .
highly recommended !
also , because of the size and consistency of the laptop computer , some websites would n't even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems .
my previous purchases were with dell and hp .
i would have to say that overall its great !
if you start on the far right side and scroll to your left the start menu will automatically come up .
very long-life battery ( up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings ) .
please make these !
money and time well spent !
we paid for the three year warranty and the extended warranty after that one ended as well .
i did n't want to buy a generic brand computer but it is really nice .
it has many great programs , such as ilife , iphotos and others .
the only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible .
however , i may have inadvertently thrown out one of the batteries with the shipping carton .
i ' have had it for about a 1-1/2 and yes i have had an issue with it one month out of warranty .
so , i thought why not give mac book pro a try .
it has 3 usb ports , 1 sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion .
i am very happy with my first mac .
unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you ca n't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small .
everything about this computer is easy to use .
i like the design and its features but there are somethings i think needs to be improved .
the quality , engineering design and warranty are superior -- covers damage from dropping the laptop .
now am very apprehensive about toshiba laptops .
the video card is great for media , and above average for gaming , but not a gamers first choice .
i am however pleased that it is still hanging in there .
needs longer lasting battery , more than 1 to 2 hrs .
my one complaint is that there was no internal cd drive .
the ease of use is wonderful .
i can actually get work done with this mac , and not fight with it like my tired old pc laptop .
i find it not to be very user friendly .
while it was highly rated , would i like it ? i tried the keyboard at the store , and it seemed ok .
i consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need .
i like how the mac os is so simple and easy to use .
but then , something goes wrong .
i needed a driver for my hp and they would not help me with out me paying over $ 50 for it .
i 've lived with the crashes and slow operation and restarts .
- stay away from apple , or hope you laptop does not break down .
i have three words : piece of junk !
it has just enough ram to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs .
heck , if i had enough ' money , i would but it as a gift for someone .
i do n't use my laptop in a way though that needs a long battery life so it 's perfect for me .
after purchasing this thing , i find out that i need a special interface device to connect my camera , and that it can not be purchased at the store - only on line .
clearly , there is something wrong with the product and lg did n't take up the responsibility .
in those three years , i 've had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by apple quickly and easily .
also you may need to charge it once a day , if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it .
although i do believe that windows operating system may be to fault for some of the problems .
i 've been having endless problems since i bought the computer - only 1 month ago
should be there by the end of the week ( again ... ) .
for the same price , you get a lot more in the asus .... 1920x1080 res .
you will need them if you want to reload the os ( i recommend doing if you can to start fresh and optimal ) .
i bought it to be able to dedicate a small , portable laptop to my writing and was surprised to learn that i needed to buy a word processing program to do so .
the battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes .
it seems to be incompatible with everything else .
aside from the trial software and the short battery life , lack of a webcam , its great .
called tech support and got the usual acer " we do n't support software but for $ $ $ we can help you " i explained there was no software involved in booting .
i really wanted a mac over a pc because i used a mac in high school .
i am now making a point to avoid their products and i hope my experience can serve as a warning to you as well .
the battery life also does n't keep up with the claim but still i think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack .
so honestly , i was n't expecting anything less than perfection , and i was n't disappointed .
the apple engineers have not yet discovered the delete key .
before i got my macbook , i owned a dell laptop .
if what you need is a machine to do some surfing , email checking , word processing , and watching a movie or two , this is the machine you want .
it was very easy to just pick up and use -- it did not take long to get used to the mac os .
a couple months later , they change my hard drive .
i love how easy every thing is to do on my apple products .
but i do n't see it as a problem .
those things are very important - vital even !
and the fact that apple is driving the 13 " rmbp with the intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered ( to me .
i use it now more than i even thought i would .
my life has been enriched since i have been using apple products .
mac tutorials do help .
most everything is fine with this machine : speed , capacity , build .
i would recommend not buying this product .
- i propose that they can just swap the hard drives .
price was higher when purchased on mac when compared to price showing on pc when i bought this product .
anyways i bought this two months ago and when i first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporarily in save zone .
basic computer .
it came before the day it supposed to which is great .
the sound as mentioned earlier is n't the best , but it can be solved with headphones .
let me start with the good : so awesome .
the newer macbook that i have purchased is one of the best computers .
do n't waste their money , save it and but a mac .
the lcd screen stopped working on mine after 10 months .
it is extremely fast and very compact .
the mac version of microsoft office is cheaper than buying the actual and works just as well .
does everything i need it to , has a wonderful battery life and i could n't be happier .
i noticed windows has a new system called windows 7 , what about us vista users ? they should get all the bugs out of vista before investing in a new system .
although i was promised about 10 hours , i found myself to a limited 7 hours ( which is still amazing ) .
i 've had hp desktop for over 4 yrs now and not one days goes by that i do n't regret buying it .
additional caveat : the base installation comes with some toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user 's liking .
i 'm not exaggerating when i say this computer is perfect ... it is !!
they do n't seem to be susceptible to viruses , which is one less big thing to worry about when it comes to computers .
my macbook is faster than any comparable pc .
tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again .
but if you are in the computer field you probably would n't be here .
while lacking some of the functions of the other versions , this was very acceptable for the uses planned for this computer .
previous laptops were pc 's , still have them , but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system .
i have had at least eight toshiba laptops , and they have been outstanding , including this one .
well i spilled something on it and they replaced it with this model , which gets hot and the battery does n't make it through 1 dvd .
the windows 7 starter is , in my opinion , a great way to think about using your netbook : basics , basics , basics .
i tried several monitors and several hdmi cables and this was the case each time .
this thing is awesome , everything always works , everything is always easy to set up , everything is compatible , its literally everything i could ask for .
however i dealt with this problem for over a year and it was more of a hastle then i have ever had with anything .
when i am at starbucks between clients i get full bars on my hp and 1 bar on my eee pc .
pc users work in word , while mac users work in pages .
it is of high quality , has a killer gui , is extremely stable , is highly expandable , is bundled with lots of very good applications , is easy to use , and is absolutely gorgeous .
so you might ask , what did apple do for me ?
after the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace .
you know what ? i happened to buy a defective blood pressure monitor a week ago at the bukit batok polyclinic nhg pharmacy a week ago .
i especially like the keyboard which has chiclet type keys .
it was not clear that the microsoft student edition that was loaded on the computer , was a six month trial .
i spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare .
for me , keys were starting to get stuck and would n't type very well .
most of my papers could not be saved and when they could be , half the time , the papers were then erased .
i had to pay for the shipping !
so i called customer support ( which is good too ) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all , i just chose to hide the message .
only problem that i had was that the track pad was not very good for me , i only had a problem once or twice with it , but probably my computer was a bit defective .
if you already own a 2009 , 2010 , or early 2011 model , you should wait until the next update .
no i am generous calling it slow .
there is no number pad to the right of the keyboard which is a bummer .
ms office 2011 for mac is wonderful , well worth it .
the only thing i can imagine is that sony jumped on early specifications for vista requirements from microsoft and designed it to those inadequate requirements .
they claim call center is still down .
the few things that are wrong with it are very minor things .
the body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up .
am very glad i bought it , great netbook , low price .
you will not regret buying such a great thing like this !
it 's a joke .
pdf files can be viewed instantly .
you have to toss out the wifi card and replace it just to have any sort of network capability .
apple is always great about the aesthetics of things , they always come up with good looking products .
best commuter i have ever owned .
call tech support , standard email the form and fax it back in to us .
they had me send in the machine last april returned it to me in may with no documentation on what was done it anything .
i can use it for all of my needs .
the 2.9 ghz dual-core i7 chip really out does itself .
my favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so i can connect it to a bigger screen .
i like the laptop overall .
after sending out documents via email and having recipients tell me they could not open the documents or they came through as gibberish , i broke down and spent another $ 100 to get microsoft word for mac .
i am able to play 720p and 1080p media files just fine with it .
i have had two toshiba satellite computers and while they are okay , they are in no way comparable to the mac .
my mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary .
every single one we 've gotten we 've had problems with .
i am a huge computer person i love any kind of computer that works well , but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing .
my son said it popped up and he clicked update .
no viruses .
the smaller size was a bonus because of space restrictions .
i love the size , keyboard , the functions .
they informed me that i had around 7 " policies " or viruses on it .
the buttons you have to press a little harder than most .
first , you ll discover that the word processing program known as appleworks rarely translates perfectly on anyone else s computer , if it translates at all .
when we bought our new hp computer in dec. of 2008 , we wanted windows xp , but were told it would cost an extra $ 159 , so we went with vista .
what an elegant , wonderful machine .
apple and guess what , you have to send the whole laptop in , too bad , so sad
the overall build quality of the unit is excellent and she 'd recommend it to anyone else looking for a netbook .
we used pc products - it seemed simpler to continue with the same thing .
waiting for the i7 was well worth it , great value for the price .
sure , the initial out of pocket expense is greater , but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet , and when i factor in all the money in that i wasted on geek squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested pcs , it probably comes out about even anyhow .
this time the mouse pad and right click key would n't work !
the difference is the toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space .
if that is the case , then i am completely happy
i am definitely sold , and not going back to pcs for home use !
its more like a snail crawl .
after the first few months , the computer started crashing about every week .
just a bunch of idiots who 's english as a 5th language is forced at best .
the product is prefect for everyone .
it 's macbook pro and there is no discussion about it .
i love the keyboard .
windows is also rather unsteady on its feet and is susceptible to many bugs .
i took it to the shop and they said it would cost too much to repair it .
i 'm having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying $ 176 every 3 months just is n't worth it ( that 's about how long the port seems to last ) .
now , as easy as it is to use , and i do think it is a great starter laptop .
returned laptop for a 3rd repair and it came back with previous problems fixed ( except for speaker grill ) but the unit started locking up during use and eventually would not operate at all .
i will have to say that i love my macbook pro !
have used only macs for years .
hard disk - the new editions gives you more hard disk space ( 500gb instead of 320gb ) but time has taught me never to trust an internal hard disk .
just keep in mind the graphics is not dedicated so loading the movie almost took a minute , but it ran fairly smooth for a non-dedicated graphics card .
i took it back for an asus and same thing - blue screen which required me to remove the battery to reset .
dell wanted to charge us for everything everytime i called them with a problem .
the large screen also helps when you are working in design based programs like adobe creative suite .
if you need an affordable , entry-level laptop , this will fit the bill .
will not buy another toshiba , this is my second , not happy w / either .
i 'm not going to lie , i 've never really liked the acer brand in general .
i think it was around 16 hundred bucks last i checked .
apple is aware of this issue and this is either old stock or a defective design involving the intel 4000 graphics chipset .
it was a total hell experience that i will never repeat .
it works fine with our wireless and they 've had not problems .
ilife is easily compatible with microsoft office so you can send and receive files from a pc .
i 've had friends with acers who seem to have had similar or exact same problems .
simply amazing computer !!
the macbook pro is extremely thin and light compared to those heavy windows laptop .
it works exactly like it did the day i took it out of the box .
this computer was bought because i wanted " top of the line " , fast , reliable , ha .
i am not sure if it was the drive itself , however ;
you can even run a parallels type program easily and run any leftover pc software that you absolutely can not be without .
lord have mercy !
i 'm pretty sure it 's not newegg 's fault but when you turn on a computer you just bought you want it to at least get to desktop .
problem fixed which is great but there went another two weeks without my laptop at school .
it is good to know that i can mobilize without having to worry about the battery life .
my only other complaint is that it gets really hot .
the computer first started malfunctioning 3 months after purchasing it .
this purchase opened me to the world of macbooks , and i am impressed with the intuition of the design , the beauty of the product , and the excellent technological advances associated with it .
one of the wonderful things about macs is that they are virus free .
asus facial recognition does n't work and windows logon is n't either .
be sure to have good air flow where ever you put it .
the " time remaining " goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes .
my main reason to convert was the imovie program .
get this machine
hope this helps !
( i 'm an excellent touch typist , and my hands are very sensitive , too .
and it comes with the new osx that comes with new features that makes the use more easy .
i stayed up half the night enjoying my new macbook pro .
everything else just install and go .
i would like at least a 4 hr . battery life .
my trackpad is not working .
it is not ideal for children because of the temp .
after 3 pleasant weeks of use , the laptop just died .
moral of the story : - do not buy anything from companies that do not respect their customers .
which it did not have , only 3 usb 2 ports .
maximum sound is n't nearly as loud as it should be .
sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to work
it 's ok but does n't have a disk drive which i did n't know until after i bought it .
however , the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary ( unless you 're gaming ) .
buy it , love it , and i promise you wo n't regret it .
i have been a pc user since middle school , but in my mid twenties i decided to convert to the dark side , or should i say the brighter side of life .
the fact that you can spend over $ 100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine .
although the price is higher then dell laptops , the macbooks are worth the dough .
i did contact hp and share how unhappy i am .
i 'm stuck w / a broken computer .
i bought for my son in the 2nd grade .
but i was wrong .
i did not take the class and wish that i would have .
this laptop is great for work and doing my pictures .
the latest version does not have a disc drive .
( but office can be purchased ) if i ever need a laptop again i am for sure purchasing another toshiba !!
and it is impossible to get them back in .
asus said my netbook was working properly .
if only bill gates would read some of what is said here ms would do a better job .
my next laptop will also be a mac !
its pretty much fire it up and go .
if you are looking for a netbook pc do not buy from asus !!!
the most recent being that my safari internet browser is freaking out on me , but i have just been using firefox instead .
i took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one .
do n't get me wrong , i am no microsoft hater , i 've just managed to turn into a much bigger apple fan because of this machine .
it was old but it was not till we bought the dell did we realize how great it was .
i wanted to explore what the mac was all about .
i ordered through macmall , which saved me the sales tax i would have incurred buying locally .
the latest is on my lg netbook x12
i have had many , many issues with pc 's in the past and i 'm finally glad to have joined the mac revolution !
) i also purchased applecare for $ 300 , which is a three year extended warranty , since i ve never seen any laptop that lasted more than two .
it turns out that this hp pc had been previously sold by wal mart .
i think this is about as good as it gets at anything close to this price point .
when i got it , i immediately noticed that it was quite heavy and thick and not really attractive .
i went from bestbuy to dell , windows to apple .
have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing , which is leaps and bounds ahead of pc in my opinion .
also , you wo n't have to worry about them going online a getting a virus .
it works great and i am so happy i bought it .
i simply got tired of a bad computer like windows with its constant freezing and anti-virus .
buyer beware .
other thoughts : do not purchase this product .
it drives me crazy when i want to download a game or something of that nature and i ca n't play it because its not compatable with the software .
thinking about returning it
the computer would not ever cut back on .
actually , i think i was intimidated by the change from a pc .
this computer is really fast and i 'm shocked as to how easy it is to get used to ...
it makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier .
the only objection i have is that after you buy it the windows 7 system is a starter and charges for the upgrade .
the machine is speedy and efficient .
i was waiting for this model to be released since january , and have been holding off on buying a macbook pro until the new model came out .
fast , great visual !
with no problems , i 'm happy with this purchase because i saved money compared to buying it anywhere else .
was not happy with one of the programs on it .
i had to get apple customer support to correct the problem .
i can leave my macbook uncharged for upwards of eight hours and it wo n't even be dead .
for the bluetooth to work properly , you must install the launch manager on the drivers/applications dvd , or it will not show after the reload .
i had a little problem adjusting to the small screen but works fine as long as i remember to carry my glasses .
it was secure and easy to navigate .
if i had to buy another computer , i would most definetly buy an acer one computer .
i should have been more observant .
i 'm excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same .
it is the easiest computer i have ever used
it 's perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc !
many people complain about the new os , and it 's urgent for apple to fix it asap !
everything from the design to the os is simple and to the point .
yes , that 's a good thing , but it 's made from aluminum that scratches easily .
the sheer power and flexibility makes the macbook pro a must have for any techie !
i will only buy apple laptops from now on .
i like it so much , i bought another just for my wife .
once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed windows 8 set-up you may feel frustrated .
i love my apple , it is quick and easy to use .
but to be honest , i do n't use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming .
most of them were either too big , too noisy and too slow after 2 years .
they will not let you down .
the final cut pro on this laptop is so fast and easy , and i can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer , which is also a mac .
i can never go back to a pc now , this machine never freezes or has any problems .
i had never owned a mac before ;
after 5 months of failed repairs , requested a full refund but was refused and it still is not repaired and acer is indifferent to the issue .
i 've owned this labtop for less then two months , already the mouse button has broke .
i use iphoto all the time , which is a great program for anyone who is into photography - amateurs and experts alike .
small and light weight .
it does n't bother me though .
it is blazing fast !
it 's been a couple weeks since the purchase and i 'm struggle with finding the correct keys ( but that was expected ) .
well designed and fast .
i have no problems yet on my mac so far , and hope it stays like that .
i also enjoy the fact that my macbook pro laptop allows me to run windows 7 on it by using the vmware program .
to me it 's a workhorse ... and quiet as can be ... you even save big bucks not dishing out any extra to uncle sam ... definite buy ...
i had meant to purchase the nb205 and bought this one by accident ( long story ) .
update : two years after buying this laptop , i am now the proud owner of a lemon .
i work as a designer and coder and i needed a new buddy to work with , not gaming .
unfortunately , that is not the case .
it out performs any other laptop on the market today .
and the speakers is the worst ever .
sure it has the one touch keys but that was the best feature of the computer .
received the product promptly and without any issues .
i have been a mac user since the mid 90s .
nice screen , keyboard works great !
! so nice . . stable . . fast . . now i got my ssd !
first of all , they had no record of me having the 3 year warranty i 'd paid almost $ 400 for , and i had to call in , spend hours on their online chat service , and fax in multiple documents .
great investment !
i have had another mac , but it got slow due to an older operating system .
it was weird .
maybe this is virus related , maybe not , but the computer has locked up many times , and on two occasions , the screen has simply gone black .
as it turns out , i just did n't know any better .
working with mac is so much easier , so many cool features .
they told me to reprogram the computer , and i did n't need to do that , and i lost pictures of my oldest first 2 years of her life .
the apple macbook pro nothing to say but professionally great and outstanding .
this device has met my expectations and i 'm sure it will meet yours .
overall , this is a wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase !
the specs are pretty good too .
the speed is fine .
the hardware problems have been so bad , i ca n't wait till it completely dies in 3 years , tops !
treat yourself to a more expensive , long-lasting laptop of quality like a sony , apple , or toshiba .
startup times are incredibly long : over two minutes .
it was an all around waste of money for me .
for my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin ( it happened 7 months ago ) they offered me an itouch 8gig ( you know it is a bit insulting when a company this rich , offer a loyal customer like me , a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this ) .
the screen is bright and the keyboard is nice ;
its pretty fast and does not have hiccups while i am using it for web browsing , uploading photos , watching movies ( 720p ) on occasion and creating presentations .
i was tired of going without my laptop every few weeks .
one of them seems to have worked .
it 's fast at loading the internet .
it is very well built .
with what i do know how to do , the computer works beautiful .
i must keep it plugged in at all times because it will not keep a charge for longer than four minutes .
i used windows xp , windows vista , and windows 7 extensively .
had to have this computer repaired twice in the first 5 months after purchasing it .
it is fast booting up , shutting down , and connection with the internet .
excellent product for the money .
the audio volume is quite low and virtually unusable in a room with any background activity .
applications open in seconds and there are no lags , hiccups or awkward moments when you wonder whether your computer is out for tea .
there is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle , and when i click on it it says : " consider replacing your battery " and it does not hold full charge .
and toshiba is totally unconcerned .
currently if i use the laptop i ca n't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs .
i am most impressed with the programming , including the iphoto .
you better believe my next computer will be a mac !
beta had better quality , but vhs became the industry standard .
back then my entire family was devoted to the sony name .
instead it is sitting in west virginia waiting for ups to take two days to send me a box and two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air ? to louisville ky .
this computer had exactly the specifications i needed .
turns out this is a common problem .
i just hope the reputation that toshiba has is true and i wo n't have to worry about a crash .
i did an internet search and this is a very common problem with this laptop .
this machine is amazing .
macbook notebooks quickly die out because of their short battery life , as well as the many background programs that run without the user 's knowledge .
bought for my daughter to take for starting college this fall - she has been on it non-stop ever since " learning how to use it " .
it is a bit heavy .
toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought toshiba will do nothing about it .
everything was so easy .
while apple 's saving grace is the fact that they at least stand behind their products , and their support is great , it would be nice if their products were more reliable to justify the premium .
i like this machine because its very lightweight ...
okay , let 's just start out by saying i am in no way a computer techy .
i have to wonder why amazon is even selling this dinosaur .
that 's quite a bump up from the $ 599 that this little guy sells for , which leaves me to my next point .
the mcbook pro notebook will make it easy for you to write and read your emails at blazing speeds .
the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i 've ever seen .
thanks for great service and shipping !
this is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design .
and i 'm still paying the bloody financing , for a product which did n't last me at least three years !
and i can attach my projector to it .
after a couple of years , my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a company-wide recall of my particular battery .
the applications are also very easy to find and maneuver , much easier than any other computer i have ever owned .
one drawback , i wish the keys were backlit .
this was absolutely annoying !
after about a week i finally got it back and was told that the motherboard had failed and so they installed a new motherboard .
the mouse on the pad , the left button always sticks .
my review mainly talks about the difference i have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 mac book pro .
not a scratch or mark on it .
i 've saved a lot of time and headaches so far , using my new macbook pro .
plus stylish .
i bought a protector for my key pad and it works great : )
i run dreamweaver , final cut pro 7 , photoshop , safari , firefox , msn messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time .
now , , , , , my monitor has been acting up for about 2 months .
however , this will be my last as well .
this mac has been a problem since we got it .
even though i could have gotten a pc twice the speed for the same price i still think there 's nothing like a mac .
they discovered the manufacturer 's defect and sent it in for repair .
the troubleshooting said it was the ac adaptor so we ordered a new one .
this is the first laptop i 've owned , although i used several at my previous job .
it has a .1 ghz faster processor and a stock 500gb hard drive .
i had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty .
i had of course bought a 3 year warranty , so i sent it in to be replaced and ( almost 2 months later ) the dv4 is what the sent me as a replacement .
this laptop is the most amazing little peice of machinery i have owned outside of the iphone .
( 3dmark6 score is only 8500 ) .
its fast , easy to use and it looks great .
i have had the netbook for 2 months and i love it , i read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers i use .
been a pc user for many , many years .
it was kind of a rebellion against pc in fact , and i am certainly glad i did .
this thing sucks !
the macbook starts fast , does n't crash , has a fantastic display , is small and light ( i have the 13.3 " model ) , and is n't always complaining about updates , lost connections , errors , blue screens , etc .
i was also informed that the components of the mac book were dirty .
this laptop is a 100 times better than a chromebook !
i spoke with a service rep at micro center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter , so it 's not just an isolated incident !!!
so we got a good deal on hsn for an acer notebook and we bought it for him .
i bought it for really cheap also and it 's amazing .
yes , i thought the expese was a little much , but i now realize you get what you pay for .
and if u did .
i went from a macbook to this mac mini and this was a great upgrade !
they are n't worth the money , even though they are on the cheap side , laptop speaking .
the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have .
keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable .
battery life needs more life .
the speakers could have been better but it was n't a deal breaker ... this is a great little laptop ... love it !
my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that does n't require a dedicated video card .
after 2 months of complaints , asus finally sent the right power supply to my techies .
added an imac about 2 years later .
my brother is a computer wiz and would laugh at me because he used an apple .
with a mac you do n't have to worry about antivirus software or firewall , it 's so wonderful .
otherwise this little notebook has met all my expectations .
the problem i had with this unit was unresolvable .
it runs very quiet too which is a plus .
i had less problems .
you just can not beat the functionality of an apple device .
remember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product .
see when it comes to laptops you buy it and get just a normal operating system with trials of must need stuff that should come with it .
so i called compaq , and after being on the phone for 3 hours , i finally got a replacement which i should n't have had a problem getting since it was under warranty .
i do transcription work on the side , and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well .
the powerpoint opened seamlessly in the apple and the mac hooked up to the projector so easily it was almost scary .
i also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad .
all in all , a very disappointing experience except that i learned how good the geek squad is and also customer service .
this machine was a horrible experience .
was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba ? probably not ever again .
i love a " pc " but i was ready for a change and tired of the windows system .
i have a business website and every time i have to change something i have to go to the public library to use a pc .
it has surpassed all expectations and fulfilled all my needs .
it was definitely a smart move .
laptop is to be used like a netbook .
that is pretty sad when they name them specifically .
crisp screen , great battery life , and plenty of storage .
i need graphic power to run my adobe creative apps efficiently .
the durability of the laptop will make it worth the money .
i did a review on it , its awesome .
there are differences that you need to know and take time to learn .
see retired recently and decided that she wanted a laptop .
they improved nothing else such as resolution , appearance , cooling system , graphics card , etc .
if i have a few hundred dollars to spare , i 'd buy the pro line though , the 2.53 and 2.66 ghz model .
its office compatible , but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs .
this was the second computer and brand bought that day .
i preferred the fit and feel of the 13 inch .
this wiped out several programs that were installed on the computer when it was bought .
after numerous calls to applecare tech support , i was directed to send in my computer ;
the battery life is amazing , the versatility is outstanding .
in may i started having problems with the usb ports not working .
the mouse is a little bit different than what you 're used to though - it has one big flat panel and one full bar ( instead of two separate ones ) to click with - but you get used to it quite quickly .
i started having problems with it within the first month .
it is so nice not to worry about that and the extra expense that comes along with the necessary virus protection on pc 's .
again .
i was so excited when my dad said i could get a new laptop for my birthday .
it 's all a bit magical .
i was extremely happy with the os itself .
pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were .
it is well worth the money it cost , very good investment .
this machine is flawless , fast , and classy .
three , the mac book has advantages over pcs ' with linux based os there is very ' few problems with system performance when it comes to a mac .
newegg 's rma service was great as always , i contacted them late friday night , and they issued me an rma number and a prepaid ups shipping label the very next morning on saturday .
it might be something deep within windows , for i was unable to create a disk image on my hard drive .
it would take up too much time to do research for my papers and i would be up hours - just because the computer was too slow .
i take it everywhere with me because it 's so easy to carry .
i just plug this into my 22 " monitor and the speedy macosx performs just as well on this dual-core that my dell did with windows 7 with a quad-core .
thank you .
they should have included more memory on their computers if they knew vista would run slowly .
i have had laptops in the past and i thought why not give these small netbooks a try .
i 'm hoping that i can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross .
it 's great and we will always stick with apple computers , we have been so happy with them .
to this day , there are none .
this is great if you have several lectures back to back and do n't have a chance to charge during one of the lectures .
honestly , i spent more time waiting for it to unfreeze then actually doing what i got on there for !
other than that i do n't have one complaint in the world !
this is another reason to like the mac .
i have had several machines over the years , both for personal and business use .
pretty disappointed about this product .
it has enough memory and speed to run my business with all the flexibility that comes with a laptop .
well , i started using google chrome , which is a little better , but it freezes too sometimes .
needless to say a pc that ca n't support a cell phone is less than useless !
cosmetically , the only thing they changed was 2 of the function keys at the top .
but not in this case .
the sound was crappy even when you turn up the volume still the same results .
! excellent performance , usability , presentation and time response .
i love this piece of equipment , it will be hard to go back to other type of laptop after using a macbook pro .
it is truly a desktop replacement .
have had many higher priced computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory and speed , etc .
the leather carrying case , keyboard and mouse arrived in two days from memphis warehouse .
i got tired of buying laptops and having them stop working after a year .
i am taking back today .
fan vents to the side , so no cooling pad needed , great feature !
it 's also fairly easy to use the operating system .
i ' v spent as much for shipping as i would to buy a new netbook -- of course a different brand .
my iphone synced right up just like a person would expect , unlike the pcs in our lives .
cons : screen resolution .
all the customers that come in hate dell .
it was also cheaper than the pro which made it even more appealing to me .
the flaws are , this computer is not for computer gamers because of the os x .
memory is upgradable .
many of my classmates computers hard drives crashed .
it has all the features that we expected and the price was good , working well so far .
this apple navigates you thru the unexplored world of the internet .
after way too many times sending the thing in for repairs ( delivery service was slow , and without the laptop i had no access to the internet , and thus no way of tracking it to find out when i might hope to see my computer again ) , it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years .
processor - when compared to my 3 week old early 2011 edition there i barely experience any difference in performance ( 2.3 ghz v/s 2.4 ghz ) .
after paying over $ 1000 for this computer , it was not worth it .
i waited to review to make sure it is what it is .
not only are the versions of these programs able to be saved , worked on and opened on both a pc and mac , the versions of these programs on a mac are graphically and functionally superior .
" for one , i noticed that from turning on my mac to logging on only took about 25 seconds .
anyway , in early july of this year , the dvd burner stopped working , and the computer stared having issues with power supply .
all you get is a box and a computer .
i made a perfect decision when i bought the toshiba !
this computer is absolutely amazing !!!
i think part of the problem with this computer is vista , yet i know vista is n't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my acer and it also has vista ( i should have waited the few months to get the next operating system ) .
that 's right , no power , absolutely nothing .
i have used pc 's and converting to this macbook pro was easy .
i have owned many different brands of laptops in my life .
the speed , the simplicity , the design . . it is light-years ahead of any pc i have ever owned .
it did n't take me long to get switched over to the mac computer programs and navigation - it 's been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better .
a key contributor that led me to mac is the art aspect .
the speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones i have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music i suggest you get something better .
i re-seated the " wlan " card inside and re-installed the lan device drivers .
but after i got used to it i love it .
so you out of of notebook and money .
until i bought the dell , i thought you just looked for what you wanted ( size , software , options , hardware ) and purchase the best deal you could find .
i asked many people , search on the net and also read reviews here in best buy .
it did not have all the features i expected it to have .
i have found it very easy to use , very informative , wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs .
it took so much time .
then i 've fixed the dc jack ( inside the unit ) , rewired the dc jack to the outside of the laptop , replaced the power brick .
with a mac computer i have more free time as i do n't have to wait for windows to boot up or shut down and all the viruses associated with windows .
so , i must say i am not a happy camper .
the price is higher than most lab top out there ; however , he/she will get what they paid for , which is a great computer .
the benefits were immediate !
this is the third in a series of macbooks starting with a black macbook .
first of all yes this is a mac and it has that nice brushed aluminum .
i spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person !
my macbook pro works like a dream , it has never overheated , or even been slightly warm for that matter .
the notebook is lacking a hdmi port and a s-video port that would enable one to hook it to a tv .
although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks .
take the simple , easy solution to your computer problems and stop waiting and smacking your old computer around .
i love this program , it is superior to windows movie maker .
i chose the ibookg4 , a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large screen big enough to please anyone .
the display on this computer is the best i 've seen in a very long time , the battery life is very long and very convienent .
summary : spend your money elsewhere
i 'm glad i bought this laptop , it was worth the few ( $ 100 ) extra dollars .
sad very sad .
i finally own a piece of computing equipment that i do n't want to take a baseball bat and destroy .
i baby my electronics so i know for a fact it was defective and not anything that i did to it .
toshiba will not acknowledge this problem .
i needed something affordable from apple and was tired of dealing with pc laptop after pc laptop .
i bought it to my son who uses it for graphic design .
i finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what i need it .
handles all my basic media needs easily .
breaks easily .
it is also very lightweight , making transporting this computer very easy .
apparently they 're not special anymore .
it works great for general internet use , microsoft office apps , home bookkeeping , etc .
there are no gold key numbers to install programs , you must use the serial numbers that it does not accept and then things are limited as far a working because they are only good for a short time .
it is not even a year old yet , so i would definitely not recommend it to anyone .
made interneting ( part of my business ) very difficult to maintain .
i was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews , but i 've found it fine to work with .
best buy was great as always and accepted the return and gave me another model 1764 .
and these are some reasons you should get a macbook pro .
the cons are more annoyances that can be lived with .
i have always wanted a macbook pro always !
apple hit a home run here .
needless to say , the leap from that to this has been amazing and ( aside from the financial reasons ) i am astounded that i had n't made the switch sooner .
either way i 'm furious .
for two months , when you guessed it .
to those thinking about switching , do it and do not look back !
seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications ( ie internet tabs , programs , etc ) simultaneously .
the case is carved out of a single block of aluminum .
runs fast and the regular layout keyboard is so much better .
it 's not inexpensive but the hardware performance is impressive for a computer this small .
i think that if it is the motherboard again so soon that they should replace it .
at $ 1899 to start , this is no cheap machine .
enjoy using microsoft office !
i own a hewlett packard laptop and i 've had man problems with it since i bought in in feb , 201
so if anyone is looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name toshiba on it ...
got this for a graduation gift for my daughter for her to use at college .
the screen is bright and clear , the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice .
which was way too much money .
the dvd burner broke after burning 3 dvd 'd during that time !
everything is falling apart internally and externally .
if you 're not wanting to be mobile , this is a good laptop to sit on a desk .
i could not handle it one hand like i can the replacement computer i purchased .
i am going to go back and return at store i bought from !
i also experience the same with my macbook air .
they said that my computer was covered on an extended warranty , and that products with extended warranties are taken care of through third parties and not sony itself anymore .
dismantle the whole thing ? then it will not be a newly manufactured set like before .
* if you are looking for a good laptop , this is not it !
it 's not a recommendation , it ' a plea .
i 'm tired of the inept service .
the laptop preformed pretty well .
i also own an hp notebook and it does n't even come close .
despite the claims of the apple apologists ( a vice of which i am recently myself reformed ) the internals of mac laptops are no different from pcs ' at this point .
i sit down and use my husband 's work pc and i do n't like it one bit .
so , after apple replaced the hard drive i enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer , until it froze this morning -- completely .
and the warranty on this macbook pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles .
the reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me ( i prefer it dark ) or if you can crank up the brightness .
it did fairly well , other than it 's poor performance , overheating and occational blue screen .
the computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan .
i will be returning it and switching brands when i get to best buy .
this is the first macbook i have ever had .
vista is a nightmare .
very disappointed with apple .
just beware no dvd slot so when i went to install software i had on cd i could n't .
it is very easy to type on and feels great - besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted .
and finally i realized that mac is the best .
i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus .
congratulations asus for creating one big piece of dump which is my laptop .
if you could stretch by a few 100 dollars i highly recommend you should replace your windows laptop with this one .
i was taught to use photoshop and was amazed .
it was still working , but there was nothing on the screen .
wasted me at least 8 hours of installation time .
of course my warranty runs out next month .
the brand of itunes has just become ingrained in our lexicon now , but keep in mind that apple started it all .
however , it did not have any scratches , zero battery cycle count ( pretty surprised ) , and all the hardware seemed to be working perfectly .
it is everything that i would want in a computer .
i like the design and ease of use with the keyboard , plenty of ports .
taking it back to best buy i found that a tiny plastic piece inside had broken ( manuf issue ) .
i 'm glad i made the choice to switch and buy this mac .
after numerous attempts of trying ( including setting the clock in bios setup directly ) , i gave up ( i am a techie ) .
i have used a computer at work but having your own personal laptop is awsome !
the only thing i did n't learn in my research was the software i would need like privacy protection and warranty protection , in case it gets broken , or crashes etc .
i would really recommend to any person out there to get this laptop cause its really worth it .
i normally do n't participate in reviews/surveys but this laptop has not given me any problems and hope to share my thoughts ...
huge apple mac fan !
excellent in every way .
they do n't translate from a mac , even on word , resulting in a ton of run-on sentences .
i got a mac as my hs graduation gift .
the keyboard is top notch .
it is easy to navigate and update programs .
i am using the external speaker - sound is good .
was very much worth the price i paid .
) i also tried the touch pad and compared it to other netbooks in the store .
2nd mac book i have purchased from macconnection .
i hate this one .
trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything , so i want to manage my time i do have to be the most efficient .
i believe with apple - you get what you pay for .
they sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still did n't work .
it was a great deal after all .
this laptop is insane !!!
being only 2 months old , i am not a happy camper !
this was purchased for my daughter and i was pleasantly surprised .
second , it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated
system is loosing about 20 % of performance because of that .
i did add a ssd drive and memory
now , i guess , i 'll have to unload my m6809 on some poor , hapless soul .
however , the experience was great since the os does not become unstable and the application will simply shutdown and reopen .
the power plug has to be connected to the power adaptor to charge the battery but wo n't stay connected .
it is easy to use , good quality and good price .
do you ever think hp would do that ? never !
the screen graphics and clarity , and sharpness are great .
speakers does n't sound that great .
i bought this laptop for my son in 2007 for his christmas present .
that was a big mistake .
i wanted a computer that was quite , fast , and that had overall great performance .
not super fancy , but not super expensive either .
the price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop .
there are a few flaws as well that i noticed .
while there are occasions that my computer will freeze or will need to be manually shut down , this occurs far less frequently than on pc computers and laptops that i 've used .
the most amazing part to me as a pc user is the startup and shutdown times - and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing .
the online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a pc .
i am pleased to report that it is one of the best presents i have received to date .
bought the first asus laptop in san francisco , returned it in santa maria , thinking it was just a problem with that computer .
very happy with my purchase .
that system is fixed .
it 's now all commodity hardware .
plus two finger clicking as a replacement for the right click button is surprisingly intuitive .
look up recipes and keep it on the kitchen counter while i cook .
i love this little one .
it gets stuck all of the time you use it , and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work .
defective software .
sure it 's not light and slim but the features make up for it 100 % .
now i could get myself a cheap computer , that will probably work a whole lot better !
if you have to ask you do n't own a mac and your just not in the know .
the keyboard is too slick .
the computer continued to give me issues and in late june it completely died again and i tried to call acer again to get it fixed and they refused to help me , they said my warrenty was up and hung up on me .
he left me , instructions on what to do when this comes up , or that comes up ......
also , if you need to talk to a representative at microsoft , there is a charge , which i believe is robbery , since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system , which most people would have went with xp if they could .
my friends or children use that when they need to borrow the net =) when i out grow this meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one and i will be buying only toshiba !
the system constantly overheats , the battery life is too short , the case is coming apart , and my core applications that i use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly .
my laptop is so light that i can take it with me anywhere .
best thing is i can use existing 32 bit old programs .
they ended up keeping my computer for almost 3 months !
i have loved this since i took it out of the box .
everything about a mac is wonderful , it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system , but you will learn fast and its all worth it .
and now i am a proud macbook owner also !
with the softwares supporting the use of other os makes it much better .
at first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and i send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later i then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now i have to send it back again to get it fixed again .
i would rate this computer at 5 stars , but considering it has a short life span i can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine .
excellent speed for processing data .
it 's the most wonderful thing in the entire world .
they replaced my hard drive as well as my mother board .
i have just had to learn to be a little harder typer than on my last computer .
i respond that i do not have the old computer and this way i would lose the data on my hard drive .
even out of warranty !
we do n't mind and you do n't matter .
i was not aware that this product can not display websites that contain flash .
all you have to do is turn it on and it works .
my kids ( and dogs ) destroyed two power cords by pulling on them .
packing and everything was perfect
sadly apple has discontinued this macbook , i think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller pros .
so i called technical support .
my house is now 100 % macbook .
so think about factoring those things in when you purchase .
stupidly , mind-numbingly slow -- then i found it can only be loaded with 2gb * maximum * .
all i can say is w-o-w .
a cheaper price should not equal a " cheap " product .
she tells me about it all the time but i tend to shut off all cognitive functions when she gets that yapper going .
the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm .
it even has a great webcam , and skype works very well .
my sisters same laptop broke about the month later for the same reason .
this computer is the ideal college companion .
the mac mini is probably the simplest example of compact computing out there .
this computer gets very hot , before shutting down .
learning all of the keyboard shortcuts only took a few minutes to get used to as some of the shortcuts are the same on windows machines .
the genius at the apple store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure .
you can read all about the details of this marvelous computer on wikipedia .
that includes transferring my music and movies .
love it love it love it !
considering another computer should be out of the question
i love the mac so much better than my work pc !
its good for playing my apps on facebook or watching movies .
both my husband and i have this model toshiba .
apple removed the dvd drive firewire port ( will work with adapter ) and put the sdxc slot in a silly position on the back .
more likely it will require replacing the logic board once they admit they have a problem and come up with a solution .
took it back as it was defective .
note that i do n't ordinarily take the time to write a review .
i love it !
my information was all lost ( my fault , i know , but i never thought i would need to back up my information on a brand new mac , the paragon of all computers !
very disappointing :
it want take it , it keep saying error .
needs a cd/dvd drive and a bigger power switch .
but i wanted the pro for the cd/dvd player .
i hate the display screen and i have done everything i could do the change it .
hieroglyphics are quite common .
great overall .
externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off , after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit , and the screen has a terrible glare .
i 'm done with windoze computers .
the screen is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution .
do a quick search on the internet see if im the only one .
it could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have ddr5 instead of ddr3 .
i have experienced no problems , works as anticipated .
also , macbooks come with much more features which are so cool !
love the graphics , awesome programs ( including garageband ) , and really cool default background .
the feel of this is better than the toshiba , too .
quality display i was surprised with the performance and quality of this hp laptop .
it was hard to handle and operate at school .
2 months later , the battery went .
it 's like 9 pounds , but if you can look past it , it 's great !
second hdd cover has walls inside that need to be broken if you what to install one .
i 'm no regular customer i hate wasting my time with hellos and how can i help you 's .
its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action .
but the mountain lion is just too slow .
i like the mini mac it was easy to setup and install , but i am learning as i go and could use a tutorial to learn how to use some of the features i was use to on the pc especially the right mouse click menu .
i had a usb connect but , i ca n't use it because it is not compatible .
you can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever .
mostly i love the drag and drop feature .
she said its very user friendly .
it allows me to do everything i need from a computer and more .
the tech store i purchased this from sent it back , , , , , eventually i got a new or repaired machine approximately 3 weeks later .
its sad because their commercials are great .
the 2 gb of ram is plenty , able to run windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown .
also stunning colors and speedy
10 plus hours of battery ...
macs are amazing !!
please , anyone who is considering getting this computer , stop .
i tried out another mac for a few months before buying this one and it is a great machine .
i bought this macbook pro to replace my six-year-old pc ( a sony vaio ) , but it was basically no better than my old pc , so i returned it .
since i keyboard over 100 wpm , i look for a unit that has a comfortable keyboard ( no keys sticking or lagging , strange configuration of " extra key " , etc .
the last new mac i bought was in 1998 .
the only thing i wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16 " laptop does .
would like more trendy , high tech features .
but i needed a laptop for school use .
first off , i really do like my mbp ... once used to the os it is pretty easy to get around , and the overall build is great ... eg the keyboard is one of the best to type on .
the macbook pro 's physical form is wonderful .
i am a college student and it has been very useful .
i used to build my own desktops from the component parts , and recently my 7 year old pentium 4 with ht 1 gb ram sata desktop stopped working ( this was a rock star 7 years ago ) .
maybe it 's acer , maybe it 's msft .
so far so good with this laptop .
they are simpler to use .
it 's a mac !!
computer has been at service facility more than in my hands .
it 's so useable and responsive .
it weighed like seven pounds or something like that .
what angers me more than anything else is that i spent all those years hating macs when i could have been getting a lot more production with a whole lot less grief !
*** the review below is no longer relevant , apple has fixed the issue .
i made the right decision .
overall it 's an amazing product , 5 stars !
my laptop cost approximately $ 2,300 and died after only 2-years , 10-months and 18-days of use .
being a pc user for many years to switch to a mac i will not go back .
i had a toshiba for 10 years .
this macbook is an outstanding product with great value .
they refuse .
screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment .
i love everything about this computer .
since i never really got to use this , i ca n't comment on anything except what went wrong after trying 2 of them .
it 's so bad that i 'm thinking i only got half a battery or something .
i was so excited to get this in the mail i nearly gave myself a heart attack .
after years of using pcs , a new mac user is basically forced to re-learn how to use a computer .
the keyboard is slick and quiet and not bulky like some other laptops i have had in the past .
it 's software and speed enable it to do amazing things .
i loved it then , but unfortunately it was before the days of wireless internet .
perfect trifecta !
great purchase and i definitely did n't miss out on the black friday deals .
my battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars !
also the speakers are not very loud , but it is a netbook .
i complain again ...
i even got my teenage son one , because of the features that it offers , like , ichat , photobooth , garage band and more !
the only thing i do n't understand is that the resolution of the screen is n't high enough for some pages , such as yahoo!mail .
strong build though which really adds to its durability .
i also purchased iwork to go with it which has programs for word processing , spreadsheets , and presentations ( similar to microsoft office ) .
the material this pro is made out of seems a lot nicer than any pc specs : like i said this performs a lot better than any computer i 've had in the past .
what i 'd like is for the laptop to run well without having to purchase additional memory .
the best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once , it never slows down .
whenever i call dell about an unrelated problem , they ask me if my laptop is running slowly and if i 'd like to purchase more memory for $ 75 .
but as time went on i found it almost impossible to keep the thing on-line through wi-fi .
i was psyched .
i bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room ;
for 2 months .
buy the separate ram memory and you will have a rocket !
i especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems !
apple is living up to its name with the mini and , for our needs , it 's perfect .
so glad i decided to upgrade !
the toshiba laptop was a great purchase .
it was over rated !
it s heavy for mac book but is good .
i 've never had problems with viruses .
i was happy with my purchase of a toshiba satellite l305d-s5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the toshiba warranty .
i also travel with it and it never gives me any problems .
the speed gives you the power to work on these projects seamlessly , and multiple at a time if you so wish .
easy to set up and go !
the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-pad hard to use when using headphones / mic , not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person .
i should have checked this before i installed my applications .
during that time , i had to send it back 3 times .
it 's more expensive but well worth it in the long run .
both computers started acting extremely slow within the first year of owning them .
i have been very pleased with the performance of this laptop .
keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed .
best buy ended up junking the computer and giving me a replacement computer .
also , i issued a replacement rma for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the screen , which is noticable to me .
i would tell the technician i knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and i had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me i needed to send the computer in .
sound card is limited though .
i 'm glad it waited , this one is great .
the graphics were awful and the warranty is n't even worth the cheap payment on the computer .
overall this laptop is great .
this is why i purchased a brand new laptop in the first place so it would n't have any problems .
just what the doctor ordered .
he came into my house , fiddled around on the computer for a good forty minutes and got ready to leave before it was even done doing what he was doing to it .
did n't expect to repair it at once !
the mouse is way way way too sensitive .
itunes is a handy music management program , and it is essential for anyone with an ipod .
this is what a laptop is supposed to be .
luckily i had a student task force able to help , or else it would have crashed within the first year .
files as well would become lost , deleted or corrupted .
my first laptop was an acer that i got for christmas .
i will never buy ( refurbished ) again , i do n't care how cheap it is .
its ease of use and the top service from apple - be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar - can not be beat .
all the yada-yada .
i thought the transition would be difficult at best and would take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new mac ecosystem .
the performance is awesome .
this was a gift for my grand son .
it was heavy , bulky , and hard to carry because of the size .
hp said it was out of warranty .
3d rendering slows it down considerably .
those moments in time where you want to throw something against the wall ? yeah , i wanted to throw that laptop out the window and light it on fire .
after they found no other way , they told me to courier it to them ( since they do n't allow the use of the post office ) at my expense , and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it would n't be covered .
the settings are not user-friendly either .
for me , five stars is not enough .
this one , in my opinion , might be a lemon !
ive had to call tech support many times .
it was returned on the third day i owned it .
i ordered four d620 laptops .
i tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and i still have the same problem .
could n't have asked for more !
- apple offers to send replacement and after 10 days i send them the old computer .
it is made of such solid construction and since i have never had a mac using my iphone helped me get used to the system a bit .
the people are frustrating to work with , the product itself is very cheaply made , and the accessories are less than satisfactory .
it makes a great gift .
wonderful sleek case design is only on the outside .
it has everything i would need for a home computer .
if so , you may be having similar problems .
has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device .
my kids have to take their pcs in once a year to have them " debugged " .
i switched to this because i wanted something different , even though i miss windows .
i wish it had a webcam though , then it would be perfect !
i only wish this mac had a cd/dvd player built in .
steve jobs , probably needs help and donations , and can not afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby .
toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another , and i am not kidding you , i called different hours of the day and you 'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again , since they make it sound like they do n't have your history list of your calls right in front of them .
this was around three years , maybe four years ago .
the configuration is perfect for my needs .
i bought it to use in college and it is perfect .
just do n't waste your time and money on this .
it 's also very pricey but you just have to tell yourself it 's an investment and that it 's gon na last you a long time .
a longer battery life would have been great - but it meets it 's spec quite easily .
it was fast , and it was " different " .
- they say it will take " up to two weeks " .
