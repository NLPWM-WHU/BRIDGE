this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .
the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .
as it is , i 'm keeping the machine .
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !
while it is true that it will stand on end , it is also easy to knock over that way .
ipod clearly has the most buzz .
considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .
4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ) .
many reviewers refer to it as " clunky " or " difficult " - heed their warnings .
the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod .
after os froze twice on me in the subway i returned the jukebox .
it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
- uploading music is quick and easy .
battery life :
when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .
do not buy this product --
i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine .
after looking over multiple large mp3 players , i decided to get this one .
after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .
overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
note : this will add about $ 30 to the price to purchase , but worth it
however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
it was marked up increadably high compared to other models ( almost $ 500 for a 30gb ) , and theres was nothing about it that made it worth that much money .
while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .
my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer .
i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .
cheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around .
the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .
print those coupons twice for two phones ?
it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .
be forewarned .
the ipod is a one way only machine - from computer to player .
usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .
i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago .
i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .
the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you .
p.s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ?
the other company is currently " out of stock " so i ordered another from amazon and will be taking the original back to the competitor today .
the other controls are all very easy to use .
so consider what you 're going to use the device for .
it worked .
my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .
having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage .
no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .
the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
thought i 'd weigh in here with my stats .
2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .
as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr .
i like the automatic key lock function .
the screen 's large and easily read .
. images taken indoor were n't so clear .
i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled " on " button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years .
door broke after a month .
a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images .
i purchased it at a retail store , and got an extended warranty .
i purchased the ad2600 after feeling comfortable with the reviews i read here on amazon .
but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .
if not i will avoid apex products in the future .
so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .
i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .
the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !
i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error .
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .
the camera was a marvel .
buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .
your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .
slowly yet surely my unit engorged as i read my own review , similar to when i look in the mirror .
it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .
10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .
i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations .
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music .
i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal .
i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great .
charged my battery .
mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .
with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop .
finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
at best , i 've gotten 3 hours + .
honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players .
i applied a $ 25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying $ 29 for this machine .
- no propietary headset jack
again , you can change this , but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you .
it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
i think most of you people complaining about no video is due to you hitting the wrong button either the p/n = pal / ntsc or the i/p is set to progressive scan .
the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
but for $ 49.99 go get one !
service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .
the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition .
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can ' t play everything .
so i 'm screwed .
i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com .
at first i thought it was my headphones but it was not .
the prints are beautiful !
at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .
i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .
after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd .
the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .
none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you can not make changes on the ipod that are premanent .
this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .
the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .
overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .
i did n't had any problem till now .
here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :
now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk .
it ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it .
a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .
with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .
4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately .
nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .
the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .
i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .
like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone .
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves .
if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating .
like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device .
the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough .
my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops .
if the music had been on my home computer , the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly .
it goes nicely with my apex 27 " in my bedroom .
if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more !
5 ) handle the player with care - it is not meant to be dropped .
remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s .
their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .
the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .
i am returning mine for a replacement , but if i receive another ad-2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund , but never buy another apex product in the future .
so , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit .
it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .
when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .
not a big hassle as many would have you think .
in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
controls are a bit awkward .
once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .
the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .
let 's face it - when you want to watch a movie you want to see a picture .
fact is , it could n't be easier to use .
in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .
it 's no problem for me personally .
an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press " menu " on the remote while the dvd is playing .
for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .
* sigh .
that 's important because i have a lot of music .
here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one .
only used for 3 month before it 's down !
it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .
in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software
i ordered two of these puppies for christmas gifts .
i went to an at &#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads .
navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can ' t do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad .
and since i 'm out here i can ' t mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty .
my first player ( model ad-500a ) went into the trash about 6 months after i bought it .
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .
software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search function is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .
nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much .
now i may buy two !
spend the money its well worth it .
if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .
the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28 mm filters are expensive and hard to find .
my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of .
the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend .
the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .
the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime .
a big plus in my book .
oh ... one more thing .
i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .
first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
scroll bar :
those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it .
it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
audio on video also lacking .
navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player . . .
amazon , do your customers a big favor , do n't carry this item , and give them refunds !
it takes great pictures .
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) .
and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
i upgraded to a 6610 at my local t-mobile store .
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
this is possible ! !
the service from t-mobile is very good too .
the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
* main dial is not backlit .
zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .
go get it .
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .
i can only confirm what other customers have said - crap !
this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .
so now it still plays everything , you just can ' t see it !
poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
this is my first digital camera .
i 've called the service number and if it 's not busy , it rings forever then eventually dumps you .
despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera .
5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode .
and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .
if you are skeptical about trying apex .
6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .
card reader is included .
it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
i 've owned 6 or 7 dvd players since 1998 .
i have had it lock up after a transfer of music .
i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either .
this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties .
many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .
the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
usually around the time the 90 day warranty expires .
in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .
- included creative software is pretty poor .
i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base .
the interface used could be better designed .
i love the quality of the pictures .
this model has come down in price since i purchased mine .
buy this camera , you wo n't regret it .
i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .
size - bigger than the ipod
however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .
well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players .
it plays all my back-ups , + or - , and everything else i have put in it without a hick up .
not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording
here 's why :
i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name .
there are n't many reviews for the iriver ihp .
all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .
and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?
they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product !
song transfers were not an issue .
the lcd screen was very large and readable .
sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .
the manual mode is feature rich and i can ' t wait to get the hang of it .
i think for about $ 40 more , you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though .
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy .
resources : http://www.nomadworld.com , http://www.nomadness.net
the zen has no stop button .
i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .
what a disappointment .
granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player .
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .
the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
and then it breaks .
before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex tech support , or run the player over with your car , try these simple troubleshooting ideas first .
i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8-1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .
the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least .
- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .
back to the 2600 :
+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit
it is a very amazing product .
also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .
maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .
+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .
vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .
6 . the g2 's " color effect " exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable " effect func " menu option available in all exposure modes .
i 've bought 3 apex dvd players now .
i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .
1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy .
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon . never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
i 'd look elsewhere .
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it .
else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately " fine ** " picture quality " image size : 1600 .
the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
2 ) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one .
i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .
i bought the 2600 because it plays everything !
unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .
all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
30gb is more than enough for most people .
the nomad is sent back to creative labs .
i searched on the internet and found one tip which solved our problem : press i/p button on the remote control .
this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .
personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .
it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .
easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton .
i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 .
it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .
i can ' t believe people continue to pay those prices .
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .
i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .
i 've been using it for about 3 months now .
since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the " duplicate name " problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title / artist / album .
comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
you can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks .
one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
lastly , the price is fantastic :
it sure does !
great camera , and for the price you can ' t beat it .
that takes up half the space of mp3 's .
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .
my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource .
a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .
would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
meaning i do n't have to manually clear the list , and then load the new list .
on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers .
however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone .
i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 .
so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them .
it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .
several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .
it 's not a big deal for me .
battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .
is this possible to fix , if so how , if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this ?
i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing .
i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .
i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .
features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names .
the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .
i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player .
i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded .
highly recommended !
i wish i could give negative stars !
in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .
it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation .
for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison .
i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive .
the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .
this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .
you can find any song quicky by an artist , album , or genre search .
this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .
5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .
so far not going to get a good review .
if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .
this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it ( which i could do with my flash player ) .
all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
hi , many people are saying , " you get what you pay for , i guess . "
to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;
whereas some folks have the " ipod " , i have the " nomad jukebox zen xtra " ( not to be confused with the " nomad jukebox zen nx " ) .
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .
if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .
the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .
the software is great .
i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .
no line out jack - as i said , there is none .
the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings .
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .
4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
great price .
overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera . .
i have my mp3 's stored on my workstation .
excellent range of metering options as well .
if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get " stuck " rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .
feels solid in hand .
you might think you are saving money by buying an apex but in the long run you will spend more .
i was prepared to love it .
pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
interface - practically seamless .
who cares if it does n't have multiple slots ?
this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .
well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .
you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit
- bright , visible screen
however , i do n't know the dvd 's performance on a heavy load of every-day viewing .
so if you have xp , be prepared for this and do n't be alarmed .
when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .
4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is " sold out " or more likely " discontinued " at the almighty amazon.com ?
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .
i 'm starting to listen to cd 's that i have n't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place .
the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .
i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .
zen good points :
the i/p button switches the tv display between interlace and progressive .
7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .
if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
apex 's website is down and they wo n't answer their phone .
had to buy my dad a different dvd player locally ( panasonic ) which worked just fine .
the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips .
i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 !
this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .
its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
1 . creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?
i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .
the battery life is amazing .
i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots .
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
i have not yet discovered the internet features yet , which i will be doing soon .
if i had to do this again , i might get the 40gb zen .
buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short .
songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .
this almost made it worth the price alone .
this is pretty cool .
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n't had any problems .
i bought an ipod and am very happy with it .
next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .
after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds .
just get some new headphones and your set .
hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) .
you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture .
is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?
first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good . . .
buttons do seem a little sticky tho . . and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem . .
final verdict :
the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .
most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .
spend the extra 20 $ and buy a name brand dvd player .
. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth .
what task do they perform ?
bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .
great colors , pictures and white balance .
the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .
it 's probably good for the health of your ears , however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range ( and my hearing is fine ) .
from what i 've heard it 's at least equal .
also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .
the second one was the 2500 which i think is better than the 2600 because it has more features such as karoake which i do use sometimes for parties .
you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc .
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .
you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions .
if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc .
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .
if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .
the included earbuds were uncomfortable . uncomfortable -1
what is up .
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time .
a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .
so buy the g3 .
the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .
if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country .
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn " t work either !
basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .
you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod .
a few things that might make it even better :
mixed bag i guess but the price was right .
i can ' t fit all that resolution ( 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol . ) in my 19in flat monitor ( 1200x1024 resol . ) anyways .
it 's a shame , but mine is going back .
i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
this thing is trash .
when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .
nokia has definitely won me over with this one .
this is almost it but not quite but the price was right .
the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .
- some features in the user interface
i would n't gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas .
what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .
new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays .
with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .
while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs , mine has run well , and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase .
just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine .
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .
( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) .
i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .
the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .
that beside you are prob . very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for , and one that has not yet been mentioned : using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port !
please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .
also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 " tv ) .
so i contacted customer service at creative , but they said , " if the product seems broken , we can not help , " or something to that effect .
it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can ' t access them quickly when you need them !
prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .
nice little phone ... light compact . .
they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .
for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds .
1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .
i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .
the g3 looks like a work of art !
1 no direct firewire to the camera .
the t610 has the most functionality hands down .
can ' t say whether i rec 'd an " updated " model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me .
her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .
truly , i am quite impressed . . ! !
this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
with progressive scan , i expect it to play play play - and give my old pioneer a rest .
7 picture quality is excellent .
but who wants the wires involved .
it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes .
my personal favorite is the karma ( i currently own a karma , a zen usb 2.0 , a philips hdd100 , and an upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder ) .
it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .
its quiet .
after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends , i bought this nokia 6610 .
the movie mode is also working great .
so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about .
recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) . . .
a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here .
about 10 % of the time it can ' t find the device when i attach it to my pc .
i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed .
3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
the player kept displaying " no disc " , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * !
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later .
i forgot , the case does n't fit .
i expect the g3 will please me for years to come .
personally , i do n't understand all the complaints about the interface . . .
it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims .
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product .
after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks , i searched for a smaller alternative .
the player controls are too easy to hit accidentally .
it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .
1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive .
picture scrolling in b/w :
the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35 mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .
it is crystal clear .
i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched !
no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .
it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .
i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s , and it 's a lot nicer to access them 4.5 gb at a time ( dvd-r ) than 0.7 gb at a time ( cd-r ) !
night mode is clear as day .
the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .
also , you can store data on it , which is a plus . for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .
i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing .
5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .
not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
i do n't think i was asking too much .
navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .
i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .
with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35 mm prints .
with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot .
creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .
learning how to use it will not take very long .
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of " now playing " interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all .
nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .
they refunded my $ $ $ so fast and paid for the shipping back .
one still works fine , the other quit after one day .
after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .
1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .
the moveable lcd screen is great .
simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .
i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper .
well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .
i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .
great phone . . .
although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
maybe more competitors will bring out similar products .
but if you 've used a slr 35 mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
when i turned eax back on the static was also not present .
battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive
it always pays off .
this is ridiculous .
there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .
i 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit .
another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .
because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll .
i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones .
it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well .
the p/n button switches your dvd players video output signal between pal and ntsc .
i cant do anything about it , and i have to send back .
i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .
this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .
the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
they said it is in stock , but they are " too busy " .
makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .
mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .
i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .
any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support .
i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .
it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .
i give it 10 stars !
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .
it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .
* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ) .
what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
i just bought the camera a few days ago .
i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) .
the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial . its very small and hard to turn so you can ' t get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .
save your cash - go for a brand that actually cares about their reputation .
that way i could keep it in the case all the time .
i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .
yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .
try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .
i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work !
it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box .
i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw . and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod , that crap sucks big donkey .... . never mind .
lastly , you can not manage anything on the ipod itself .
i was told that it is no longer available , so there must be something really wrong with it .
if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed , i would rate this a 5 star machine .
rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .
first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered .
not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software .
- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .
i just got it today and have tried to verify the claims of other reviewers .
the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings .
it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice .
11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player
the camera has a wonderful set of features .
hope the unit lasts as i 've only had it for 3 days .
the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !
i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me .
3 ) 4x zoom is nice
i call apex customer service and they told me that there is a known problem with the model playing disney and other movies and that it is not there problem so i 'm stuck with a new dvd player that wo n't play my kids disney movies .
after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common .
nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have .
however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .
that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though .
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player . for the first three hours , and then it died .
the battery is nice .
yes , i recommend it over the competition .
it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .
typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .
a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .
overall i like it .
have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid .
the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .
finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !
this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ) .
do not buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money !
nothing but hassle with this company .
i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
plays them all .
the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good .
i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the " rigor " of a business traveler .
moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
the distortion is not a flaw .
this thing plays everything i feed it .
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .
i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile " hot-spots " .
as i travelled internationally and did n't want to haul it back on a plane with me it was an expensive addition to the recycling bin .
the remote is a little hard to understand .
the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) . . .
friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it .
comes with standard rca jacks for output , along with s-video output ( s-video cable not included , must be purchased seperately ) and also component video outputs .
the phones are awesome .
sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 .
2 ) scroll button / switch
but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .
enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
and no t-zones .
though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display " lens " when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .
those used to 35 mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .
1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door .
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .
yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model .
overall , i highly recommend this phone .
it practically plays almost everything you give it .
i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered .
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .
i do n't think so .
i am enjoying my phone a lot ....
- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't .
the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .
perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest .
+ you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes , etc .
i have not used the progressive scan feature .
the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .
it has 2 games .
finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .
* price and capacity
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .
it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )
i purchased this as a christmas gift on 12-4 - 03 .
excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players .
i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't .
i might have gotten a lemon , but this is not the first report of video output failure on this machine .
however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .
the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .
it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .
but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a " yes " answer from you .
i got this a while ago knowing nothing about it .
in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .
this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways .
it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self-destructed ( do n't get me started on that piece of junk ! ) and expected it to be flawless .
if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause .
i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones .
a great new use for that underutilized computer .
that was n't pretty .
but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !
i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience .
i had been comparing the 3650 , 3560 and the 3595 but could n't settle ... then along came the 6610 , which was perfect for me .
unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .
i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .
i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .
i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .
to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
at this time , i decided to turn the player on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach 's air .
the reception and sound quality are top-notch .
the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line .
the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
you can ' t simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it .
a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names .
the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple .
at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .
if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .
as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .
does n't always register push-button movement .
now , i suddenly have no picture .
a $ 300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack ?
but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback . . . i can ' t recommend this product .
also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs .
2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
lot 's of other features that i need to find out about .
i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture quality ; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix .
i would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks , depending on how mad i felt about the crummy software .
at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast !
i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .
also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .
the powershot g3 is a great camera .
that 's a huge difference ... especially in this price range .
i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
if you 're intrested in buying a spare battery it 'll run you another $ 50 , a little steep i thought .
like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .
like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .
yes , the features are numerous .
however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
i love my new nomad , its great !
this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com .
it is made of plastic .
very large pics take 8mb each !
- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .
you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .
about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
perhaps there is a way around this delay .
manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
it 'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it .
it may have taken several years to fill this up .
it looks great - and is loaded with features .
its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .
it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !
the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .
i will never purchase anything from this company ever again and have logged my complaint with the bbb .
it does n't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive .
the player itself has all sorts of problems .
i am going to have to try an online download and see if that works .
on an average , you would charge it once a week .
reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .
it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do .
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
definetely a great camera .
this is the best phone i have seen .
the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use .
only problem , if you think it 's going to be delivered in the 24 hrs amazon claims , do n't hold your breath .
the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .
this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod .
i 'm not looking forward to ripping my entire collection every month or two .
focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
perhaps the weirdest was one of bruce springsteen 's cds from the tracks set being classified as goth rock .
- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .
the volume level of the phone is not all that good .
i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400 .
contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories .
one broke , one got stolen , and then i bought the riovolt sp - 350 .
i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .
otherwise , this player is awesome !
a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on " normal " resolution .
oh well . .
i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can ' t , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars .
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?
for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .
it also lets you remove songs from the play order .
you need your computer , however , if you want to add tracks to a playlist .
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
i purchased one of these to replace an ailing dvd player that 's a few years old .
sheesh ! !
after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .
i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .
it did have scored over all other competitors ....
it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .
get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash .
i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can ' t be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 " hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod .
but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it .
the menus are very easy to navigate .
i am not talking milliseconds .
here 's where the ipod drives me nuts .
it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to " get into " it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .
the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conductive to save driving .
it makes the dvd player to switch between interlace mode and progressive scan mode .
simply not as friendly for functional as an ipod .
they sent me a new ad2600 with the same problem .
- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc .
had no problem with it .
for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
highly recommended .
i bought this player during a christmas sale at an excellent price .
the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .
moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .
there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .
if anybody knows of a remote to work this-i 'd love to hear from you !
i 'm very glad i did .
i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .
the radio feature has superb sound quality .
i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3-year - old unit again just to see .
needless to say , the canon won , hands down .
and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .
i was a little disappointed in the low end .
however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .
i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it .
the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .
possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
i was so excited about the price and reviews of this dvd player .
c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .
t-mobile was a pretty good server .
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .
takes excellent photos .
if you are planning to buy that player , do not !
you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player .
i tried to play the song three times , with no success .
i refused to go for an ipod , i am not going to spend all that money just for the apple name and because it is " trendy " to have that player .
after that it seems like you 're on your own .
no instructions .
i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .
i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need :
it defaulted to unchangeable email .
seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .
the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .
four megapixels is great .
i took the camera and just gave it to someone .
the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .
it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc .
most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery .
accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
the vibration is not top .
i had hoped this was bought from walmart so that i could return it !
apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .
it will read and play all cd audio disc .
you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
had it for a week .
i have not been disappointed with my purchase .
just point and shoot and the photos were great .
so go and buy dis sucka beefo it all be gone an stuffff .
and also , it 's priced very affordably .
i have n't checked the resilience of my xtra yet , and do n't plan to .
great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful .
i guess i 'm just lucky to get a good working unit !
the speakerphone :
i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
i will never buy another apex digital product !
after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .
a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more .
a 35 mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
worth every penny !
no matter the format .
the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
well worth the money .
hopefully the replacement from amazon will work just fine .
sent mine back .
or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .
but i would expect that , since my movie discs have all played with no problem , the extras discs would , too , without any additional tweaking .
i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .
the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
there is usb , though .
now , for the t-mobile service :
that makes sense though , with all the substandard products they make .
if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .
the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
buy new ones asap . every time you move your face or something they pop out .
3 ) user replaceable battery
apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) .
i do n't think i will ever use the full 30gb .
- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .
" when will my t-zones work ? " , csr :
1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .
this is a good deal for music and data storage .
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .
but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .
if the dvd is stopped , it will display " playback only " .
big mistake .
what kind of a company does that !
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !
i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services .
so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )
after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .
not many .
if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .
well to say , i had a very bad history with players .
a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine .
if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ) .
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . .
it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .
we also looked at the fuji fps602 .
and how can i do that ... .
i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended .
the battery life on this phone is surreal .
i also own an " apex ad 1201 " dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1-1/2 years ago .
purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it .
is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel .
either way , can ' t go wrong with this price .
it was not my first choice .
when you load a disc , you go to an internet cite for the insertion of the names for the cd and the tracks .
i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .
very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
