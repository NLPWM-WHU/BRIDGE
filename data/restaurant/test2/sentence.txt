for meetball night .
took my mom for mother 's day , and the maitre d' was pretty rude .
although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , food-quality and service overcompensate .
i loving bringing friends here - and i do so every chance i get .
usually 3 vs. 4 items per dish .
do n't miss bloom 's on your next trip to manhatten .
the staff is n't the friendliest or most competent , and i am stickler for service , but everything else about this place makes up for it .
i think this is one of the more underrated places in the city .
food was very good , but not what i would consider out of this world .
restaurant snobs need not bother , this is a small , neighborhood kind of place .
really depends on your luck !
stepping into casa la femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in new york !
even better , they know how to cook french classics like steak au poivre and onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it .
if you were there when it first opened , give this restaurant a second chance .
i noted it was crossed off on the bill .
even with the prix fixe pricing , this restaurant is not worth it .
they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration .
just do n't do it .
it 's delicious !
the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .
there 's candlelight and music .
they have an excellent selection ( the rolls with crab are really great ) .
need i say more ?
we recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since i had my yorkie with me .
the place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic .
the have a great cocktail with citrus vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for !
it can be a little confusing as to where one goes to order , but once the food is ordered , you are in for a treat .
mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine ... but not the grunt that we received from the al di la staff .
while it was large and a bit noisy , the drinks were fantastic , and the food was superb .
definitely highly not recommended .
i only have friends .
they charge $ 6.00 for rice .
a great place to meet up for some food and drinks ...
i ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime .
lives up to the hype
amazing fresh dogs but best of all endless toppings !!!
even if the food was n't this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .
feels like family when we go there .
the potato balls were not dry at all ... in fact it was buttery .
the atmosphere is much better than sripraphai ( more modern and sleek ) .
at peak times , the restaurant is overcrowded and tables are uncomfortably close .
while this is n't classical restaurant fare , the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs .
but when we looked at the menu , there were n't a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section .
this place has realy fresh sushi and a nice large menu of japanese classic cuisine .
the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside .
all the nyu students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere .
it was pleasantly uncrowded , the service was delightful , the garden adorable , the food ( from appetizers to entrees ) was delectable .
i got the $ 10 10-piece dim sum combo , every bite of which was great .
i do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy .
it is also extremely well priced .
service is average .
visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews .
patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff .
the place 's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh .
i will be going back and heartily recommend it !
the omlette for brunch is great ...
there is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner .
by dinner time , they turn it around and mount a huge comeback !!
the atmosphere is great !!!
we could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu .
amazing food .
however , i think jeckll and hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once .
my wife and i ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food .
arigato gozimas yuka !
this place is not inviting and the food is totally weird .
if you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent service , this is the place .
the food was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive ( considering we were the only ones there for the first hour ) .
in an effort to increase turnover , the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse .
( besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city ) .
they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !
not worth it .
we were n't !
the family seafood entree was very good .
i 've eaten at pizza gruppo a few times , but more often i order delivery .
rude service , medicore food ... there are tons of restaurants in ny ... stay away from this one
i honestly do n't even know where to begin .
the pizza and wine were excellent - the service too -- but what really made this place was the backyard dining area .
food - awesome .
the pizza 's are made fresh , crispy , and ready to serve .
every time in new york i make it a point to visit restaurant saul on smith street .
the portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter .
after dinner , take your date to the huge dance floor , probably one of the biggest you 'll see in ny .
unbelievable .
they are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service .
i found it on a cold night , the perfect spot to warm up .
atmosphere is a bore .
the food was great and tasty , but the sitting space was too small , i do n't like being cramp in a corner .
growing up in ny , i have eaten my share of bagels .
i had a grat time at jekyll and hyde !
okay , so i never write but there does n't seem to fair balance of positive to negative reviews concerning green bo and it 's time to speak up - i live in chinatown .
i completely recommend casa la femme for any special occasion and to really impress your date .
i ca n't believe people complain about no cheese sticks ?
excellent sashimi , and the millennium roll is beyond delicious .
food is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an afternoon snack .
the food was delicious ( i had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top-notch .
after a seafood craving , i checked citysearch and chose to go to fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info .
out of the hundreds of italian restaurants in queens , this is among the best .
the sauce on the pizza is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they do n't skimp .
what more could you want ?
frankly , when you compare what you can have here for lunch , versus mcds or so many other sandwich shops in the city , there is no comparison .
try the pad thai , it 's fabulous and their prices are so cheap !
just because it 's cheap does not mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , it is great !
sure , the setting is nice .
while the $ 20 entree range is not overly expensive , in new york city , there is definitely better food in that range , and so sapphire , despite it 's lovely atmosphere , will most likely not be a restaurant to which i will return .
i have eaten at saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good .
nothing against a good sales call , but the tactics at amma are just too obvious .
the place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening .
while it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .
the soup for the udon was soy sauce and water .
too large for just two people but nothing was left .
i 've had the lunch buffet at chennai a couple of times , when i have been in the neighborhood .
the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce ( even its low sodium ) , the vinegar-soaked rice , and the scallion on top of the fish .
go here .
the food was good too .
worst place on smith street in brooklyn
i would definitely recommend sea if you like thai cuisine !
we will definitely go back .
not only would i not recommend jimmy 's restaurants to friends , i would strongly suggest they go anywhere but .
and i hate to say this but i doubt i 'll ever go back .
the sauce tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean .
try the times square cocktail -- ginger lemonade with vodka ( also available without vodka . )
but now that it 's under new ownership and has been renovated , it looks great .
the service is pretty good .
the side dishes were passable , and i did get a refill upon request .
the service was very attentive and very generous .
heartland brewery is a great way to start or finish your day .
i have been going back again and again .
i would recommend reservations on weekends though .
i love the drinks , esp lychee martini , and the food is also very good .
its good to go there for drinks if you do n't want to get drunk because you 'll be lucky if you can get one drink an hour the service is so bad .
a restaurant that does n't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere .
quick and friendly service .
i sometimes see the waiters do n't have enough knowledge of their dishes .
one of us actually liked the expresso - that 's it .
decor is nice though service can be spotty .
try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .
i had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , i tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .
and that 's no mean feat ...
again , i 'd be super upset if that were my employee .
but the staff was so horrible to us .
price no more than a jersey deli but way better .
definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date .
food is usually very good , though ocasionally i wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders .
when i arrived at orsay i was thrown back , in a veyr good sense .
it costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice .
please save yourself the frustration .
the man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7 , then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving ( mean while there were boths open all around ) .
bukhara is on my top 5 indian places in nyc
i am relatively new to the area and tried pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and i thought the food was overated and on the pricey side .
the food is top notch , the service is attentive , and the atmosphere is great .
the service was the only thing good about this restaurant .
i have been to roth 's twice and both times were very disappointing .
again , if you are in this neighborhood - by all means , come here .
there is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me .
look , the appetizers were really good .
oh speaking of bathroom , the mens bathroom was disgusting .
ciao bella
tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it 's one of my favorite dishes .
how this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy , or any other for that matter , is beyond me .
somewhat pricey but what the heck .
i will never visit this restaurant again .
the sandwhiches are out-of-this world !
maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but i 've experienced the same with other restaurants so i do n't appreciate such practice .
it is terrific , as is the value .
this place ... we stumbled upon it on labor day weekend .
the environment is romantic , but the food is horrible , the service is pathetic , and gabriella lies about everything she could .
when i visited my friend who lives in the upper eastside , she recommended that we go to this restaurant .
i can eat here every day of the week really lol love this place ... )
while this can hardly be called a restaurant , it is possibly the best deal in manhatten : $ 4 for a plate heaped with rice and 2-3 entrees .
delicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick-ass roti .
an excellent service
you 're going to drop some coin , but completely worth it , especially if you are looking to impress someone .
look foward to trying the ruben upon returning .
the manager then told us we could order from whatever menu we wanted but by that time we were so annoyed with the waiter and the resturant that we let and went some place else .
an excellent choice in midtown .
during happy hour !
please do n't fool us .
faan 's got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery .
no free drink .
the food here was mediocre at best .
the food is fresh , delicious , and reasonably priced .
i would go back .
so if you want a nice , enjoyable meal at montparnasse , go early for the pre-theater prix-fixe .
for each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink .
terrific menu full of unique rolls and special dishes .
better than the bagel shop on the corner , but not worth going out of your way for , in my opinion .
yes , the prices are high , but i felt it was worth it .
i 've been to several places for dim sum and this has got to be the worst .
although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out prices are different .
in reality ( to maximize potential diners ) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby .
they could n't even make a salad that was appealing .
another great place to take out-of-towners !
i have been here a few times for dinner , once for brunch and twice for lunch .
not pretentious and very economical .
if you can handle that , it 's a great place for a business dinner , fun with friends or simply a table for 2 .
if you want some roast duck , pork or chicken on rice with ginger , try them out !
they honored reservation on sunday afternoon very well .
one special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up , but save room for dessert !
mermaid inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .
the food here was great , a treat from beginning to end .
the pasta was well cooked , did n't have enough sauce though or flavor .
they make the best pizza in new jersey .
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices .
i recommend the jelly fish , drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings , certainly the stir fry blue crab .
suan is a great place that i often take my friends ( classmates ) too .
amazing !
my husband said the portions were very small , but if my main course was good to eat the portion would 've been fine for me .
what an amazing meal and experience !
dahkin also offers prix fixe lunch and buffet .
bring your date and a bottle of wine !
it 's boring on the inside , and our sushi was pretty below average ... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor .
the downstairs bar scene is very cool and chill ...
toons has recently been redone , so it 's now a very attractive space .
this is the first place i 've been that a runner remembers my order ... hope he likes his job because i have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant .
maybe it 's that most of dumont 's patrons are younger and have lower expectations , but i can not recommend dumont .
the parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed .
amma is nothing special .
meal was very expensive for what you get .
it does n't look appetizing as it 's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black , but the taste was phenomenal .
we were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date .
i went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary .
great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer .
this place does n't get the publicity that sylvias soul food restaurant does , but it should .
we ordered our appetizers , i ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon .
i do n't get it either .
i could n't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table .
the restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated .
try the olive cream cheese or the lox spread on a whole wheat everything bagel .
inside is a little cramped , but to be expected .
told us to sit anywhere , and when we sat he said the table was reserved .
with so many good restaurants on the uws , i do n't need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait-staff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care .
the place was nice and calm .
i definitely will go back .
i 've been coming here as a child and always come back for the taste .
i have been to roth 's twice and both times were very disappointing .
recommendations , of course , are required !
went to village last night for my birthday .
my wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it .
this place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .
my girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite .
the fried dumplings are great !
but their best dish is thh thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $ 23.95 is most places , but it is $ 16 here .
i know because i live nearby .
well , this place is so ghetto its not even funny .
ruby foo 's is a tourist trap .
i loved it and will be back soon .
the appetizers are also delicious !
helpful service and average price per dish $ 10 .
my boyfriend asked me if i wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead , while he de-skinned the chicken so that i could enjoy the white meat .
the sushi is always fresh and yummy and the menu is pretty varied .
and you ca n't beat the prices .
we took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it .
once you become a regular , you are treated as one .
it 's no-fuss , fast and delicious .
first of all , this place is * not * romantic , as claimed by citysearch 's editorial review .
really though , where 's the seasoning ?
even though the restaurant was packed , we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems .
the ambience was nice , but service was n't so great .
it 's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food , noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks .
the chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .
favorite sushi in nyc
maybe it was the great company ( i had friends visiting from philly – yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but i just ca n’t say enough good things about this brasserie .
i 've been several times and am totally smitten .
not a typical pizza joint , but good for a low key and fairly cheap nice sit down dinner .
surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth .
you 'll be ther for every anniversary , birthday , valentines day ...
late nite omelletes are not good here , there is no variety !
again , no apology , no is there anything else i can get you , no can i get you a drink to make up for it , nothing !!!!
brava la pizza fresca !
lobster was good , nothing spectacular .
i highly recommend the sophia pizza .
the photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look .
impressed ...
will have to return to try the chocolate !
the food is decent at best , and the ambience , well , it 's a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , i thought it was just annoying .
well , this place is so ghetto its not even funny .
be careful before you request extra spice .
same owner as the guy who owns typhoon , which is just down the street on st. marks and 1st ave.
it 's called gnochi alla nona and is found under chef specials .
okay-i do n't mind the oily part ( cause most are cooked that way ) but it was way too bland .
$ 20 for all you can eat sushi can not be beaten .
i had the black cod with yuzu sauce , which was wonderful .
the food is amazing !!!!
bagels are ok , but be sure not to make any special requests !
we had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses !
this place was the worst .
the spinach is fresh , definately not frozen ...
we 've only eaten in the restaurant once , but we have ordered many times for dinner .
hey , i think $ 2 + for a 5 block walk ai n't bad .
from the appetizers we ate , the dim sum and other variety of foods , it was impossible to criticize the food .
i have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money .
this is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates .
this place started off a little iffy , but is now one of my favorite indian restaurants in nyc ( and i 'm indian , so i should know ) .
a big disappointment , all around .
i love the simplicity and respect which was given to the food , as well the staff was freindly and knowledgable .
great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost !
the chicken lollipop is my favorite , most of the dishes ( i have to agree with a previous reviewer ) are quite oily and very spicy , espeically the chilli chicken .
have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience .
i love this place
chef waldy 's always measures up .
we live nearby bfc .
also , top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu .
the veal was incredible last night .
i live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of the pizza place at 3 am .
my girlfriend and i just spent our 10 month anniversary at lou lou .
i 've eaten at all three locations and i always love , love the food , the service is always wonderful and the prices are really reasonable .
my goodness , everything from the fish to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing .
$ 6 and there is much tasty food , all of it fresh and continually refilled .
the wine the service was very good too .
in any event , this is a place i 'll be sure to stop by again when i 'm in this part of town .
nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price .
the restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated .
pizza and garlic knots are great as well , i order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick !
maybe the secret was that we went on a sunday night and everything was great .
i fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of bbq roast pork .
i 'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food .
i ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .
have the iced tea .
love the food .
after the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner .
once you try it for a special occasion beware . . you ca n't stop !
we came across this restaurant by accident while at a dumbo art festival and thoroughly enjoyed our meal .
everyone was more then happy with his choices .
i 'm not picky - but it was actually gross .
i will go back to suan soon !
definitely try the taglierini with truffles - it was incredible .
for dinner i had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan .
-- eat club is a roving group of nyc gluttons
i do n't usually order wine with indian so i ca n't comment on their wine list or their wines .
i have been there many times , and food is good and consistent .
amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages please do yourself a favor and check this place out !!!!
however , it was worth the visit .
the wine selection ( by the glass and bottle ) is wonderful and i always recommend that friends make a reservation if they 're going to be in town .
likewise if you like really thin crust or really big slices then nick and joe 's may not be your favorite .
the only drawback is that it 's a little pricey .
i went to swiftys with some friends of the family and we had a very nice dinner , but nothing amazing .
obviously the chinese translation of this place does not mean big wong , it actually means great prosperity .
if you are looking for a good quality , cheap eats - this is the place .
i would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner .
oh , and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough - yummy !
i absolutely suggest this place .
went here last night and had a pleasant experience .
my only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you !
wonderful !
a quintessential slice of nyc pizza .
emilio , the owner , is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go .
overall , this is a great new restaurant that has been consistently good every time i have been .
by far , the best pizza in manhattan .
you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review .
food was just average ... if they lowered the prices just a bit , it would be a bigger draw .
i mentioned the squid dish was n't very good when the waitress visited .
he offers subpar service and has no personality .
for great chinese food nearby , you have wu liang ye and grand sichuan just a block away .
i must say the view of nyc is so beautiful !
you will pay a lot for the decore , but the food is no better or worse than a lot of other chinese and asian fusion places in ny .
i in all reality felt as if i had just gotten off air france and was in the 8th district in paris .
if you go here , do it on his off-night .
nice family owned traditional restaurant .
a pleasant surprise .
i 'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food .
i went with 5 friends and we lingered at the table for a bit and did n't feel rushed at all even though there was a wait .
great shabu shabu
that 's good and bad .
during busy hrs , i recommend that you make a reservation .
i recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time .
to the owners ; good job guys , this place is a keeper !
i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9 pm on a friday night because she " had a bbq to go to " that night - wtf ??
we could n't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we 're taking too much time -- amazing , we just sat down .
raymond the bartender rocks !
good , fast service .
it is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late , raucus dinner .
not to sound too negative but be wary of the delivary .
the spicy tuna roll is huge and probably the best that i 've had at this price range .
great for large groups and celebrations - our super happy waiter was the entertainment of the evening .
ambiance - relaxed and stylish .
they have very quick service which is great when you do n't have much time .
they do cater to american palates , but if you like it hot let them know and they are more than willing to oblige !
it was so bad i actually refused to pay for my food .
moderate prices .
better than the bagel shop on the corner , but not worth going out of your way for , in my opinion .
no doubt the next time we want to go out for a special occasion or are entertaining guests from out of town , spirit and bateaux will be our destination .
we went around 9:30 on a friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !
rao 's has the best service and atmosphere in nyc .
hurley 's is like cheers where everyone knows your name and they are actually glad you came .
but the pizza is way to expensive .
staffs are not that friendly , but the taste covers all .
not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring .
after hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant , and passing by it on a daily basis , we decided to try .
authentic pakistani food .
compared to ess-a , tal offers a less doughy bagel !
not a great place for family or general dining .
no gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation .
try sushimi cucumber roll .
one of my favorites though was the angry lobster , a cold lobster salad that was magnificent .
we went there , no one greeted us .
the in-house lady dj on saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests .
and i 've been to many nyc delis .
i went to ruby foos for my birthday and enjoyed our experience there .
the wine list is extensive and impressive .
there are other vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those .
it 's a nice place to relax and have conversation .
we decided to eat in tea room which was small and cute .
i will have to say , this bengali fast food joint is clearly my favorite .
coming from boston this place is like emma 's pizza in kendall square in cambridge ( although they have more funky toppings ! )
we go often for lunch and the place is packed .
i am indian , and i have tried many indian places in ny .
conveniently located too , being right on bedford ave.
during our trip to nyc , we made reservations to dine in the pool room of the four seasons for their pre-theater menu ( offering a modified menu for $ 65 pp ) .
now we moved out of the state and every visit to nyc includes a stop here .
the aesthetics of this place are like an airport lounge .
guess the 555soul ads did n't launch her big modeling career .
everything about this restaurant was special .
what is even better , is that the prices are very affordable as well , and the food is really good .
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm so delicious
great food .
check it out , it wo n't hurt your stomach or your wallet .
the bread is the soft paratha bread ( unlike the plain bread they use in calcutta ) , and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful .
its a little out of the way if you do n't live in the neighborhood , but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are .
perhaps .
it 's really also the service , is good and the waiters are friendly .
out of the hundreds of italian restaurants in queens , this is among the best .
one would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .
( and i have eaten my share ) which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve .
this restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced .
when the dish arrived it was blazing with green chillis , definitely not edible by a human .
we waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right .
waitstaff is great , very attentive .
in china the phrase for a good restaurant is hot and loud .
even my indian friend could n't believe how good and tasty everything was .
rao 's has the best service and atmosphere in nyc .
the service is good and the resturant is clean .
but $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n't include wine ?
service is not exactly five star , but thats not really a big deal .
always fresh and delicious .
there are many french bistros in the midtown area , and i wholheartedly recommend this one .
another friend had to ask 3 times for parmesan cheese .
although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .
still we keep going back : )
we always go there on the weekends and leave extremely full and satisfied .
you ca n't go wrong with this place .
but people from sichuan will die for it ) - chongqing hot pot , chongqing was the biggest city of sichuan , now became an independent province .
i loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors .
overall a worthwhile experience .
and the food was fantastic .
the food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes .
largest and freshest pieces of sushi , and delicious !
i recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal !
i would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation ( if possible )
food is great and inexpensive .
a defitely must visit .
i have eaten at some of the ' best ' sushi joints in nyc ( nobu , bond street , jewelbako , etc ) and yamato is my favorite .
there was a small wait , but shorter than i expected .
this dish is my favorite and i always get it when i go there and never get tired of it .
the food was great - sushi was good , but the cooked food amazed us .
for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .
it took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer .
however , service was as plain as sesame crusted salmon i had .
the ambience was nice , but service was n't so great .
definitely not a restaurant to skip !
this place has beautiful sushi , and it 's delicious cheap .
the waitress remembers me and is very friendly , she knows what my regular is and that 's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd .
a friend from seattle and i went on a thursday night around 8:30 .
could have had better for 1/3 the price in chinatown .
the wait staff is friendly , and the food has gotten better and better !
i 've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious .
i went to common stock for brunch and i was so impressed .
i recommend ordering in on a weeknight .
reliable , fresh sushi
but the best pork souvlaki i ever had is the main thing .
unfortunately , the food was not something to get worked up about .
i would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices .
the food was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over-bearing or rushed .
my friend is 100 % right in the experience we had .
the menu changed , portions were even smaller than before , a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility , a basmati rice dish lacked flavor .
for the price , you can not eat this well in manhattan .
most importantly , food is excellent .
and the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating .
highly recommended to all !
sometimes i get good food and ok service .
not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate decor will make you feel like you ’re no longer in the city .
the banana pudding they serve has never seen an oven , the crabcakes are way over salted and do n't get me started on the very greasy mac and cheese .
you will find everything about trio to your liking !
delivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week .
there is a downside if you 're ordering in -- the delivery guys have major attitude .
my husband and i have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar ( chef yoshi ) and ordered everything ala carte .
i work near-by , and they have the best oatmeal in the neighborhood - not a packaged or quick-cooked item .
good food : my favorite is the seafood spaghetti .
first it took us a long time to find the place .
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8 pm .
delicious crab cakes too .
we were pleasantly surprised with our choice .
i am not a vegetarian but , almost all the dishes were great .
the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it ) .
we thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like .
alias is warm and cozy and you do n't get that squished-in feeling you get at 71 clinton .
the service is great , my soup always arrives nice and hot .
delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door .
like saying her bread comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it dowtown manhathan .
offerings like hot cakes and the egg mcmuffin sandwich are available for breakfast .
this was the perfect quiet , relaxing , and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater .
i had the salmon dish and while it was fine , for the price paid , i expected it to have some type of flavor .
my gf 's duck confitte was very solid as well , although i have little base of reference .
wonderful at holiday time .
all of the apetizers are good and the sangria is very good .
people dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans .
stay away from the latter since you wo n't go for seconds ( hint hint ) .
still stay away , the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer ...
this restaurant is absolutely beautiful .
good bagels and good cream cheese .
the best burger i have had in the village .
i went in one day asking for a table for a group and was greeted by a very rude hostess .
you do n't go to mizu for excellent service , you go for the large amounts of food , the amiable atmosphere , and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place .
simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions .
ca n't wait to go back .
the service was great , and they have a whole great deal for birthdays .
the food is great and the prices are reasonable .
the fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale .
the atmosphere is n't the greatest , but i suppose that 's how they keep the prices down .
add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .
the price is reasonable although the service is poor .
we both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh .
it 's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic , even .
also , if you do n't want to sit at a certain table , you do n't have to !
if you go for the pre-theatre menu , it 's an even greater deal .
i highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try .
they had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice - result - we had large chunks of burnt rice in our serving bowl .
great burgers , grilled cheeses and french fries .
while their kitchen food is delicious , their sushi is out of this world .
i look forward to eating here again
the bill is approximately $ 25 for 2 at lunch without drinks .
the waiters are very friendly and helpful and if you frequent they will remember you .
the best pad thai i 've ever had .
i absolutely loved this place .
it could have been handled better .
it 's just average , just shredded , no seasoning on it .
delivery service is great too .
the food was authentic .
we were 10 people celebrtating a birthday , we sat in the tent .
not what i would expect for the price and prestige of this location .
what a great place !
the other night we had the $ 30 three course meal and everything was delicious - if i could of licked the plate clean i would of .
the wine the service was very good too .
ok , so the servers wander around a little clueless , but there 's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it 's fine , you just have to make a small effort to get their attention .
i like cafe noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent !!
i just read mocaramel 's review and felt compelled to respond .
i had the mango chicken and i ca n't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful .
always good drinks and service is pretty good ;
i ordered a lassi and asked 4 times for it but never got it .
however , if you want great food at a great price and do n't mind the decor , you ca n't beat this place .
it 's a small cute restaurant .
maybe tomorrow ; - )
so so so so so good !
just moved to the neighborhood and we 've been trying all the west village sushi restaurants .
go inside and you wo n't want to leave .
the fish was adequate , but inexpertly sliced .
if you are going for the food , it will not be worth it .
i did n't take a look at the rest menu , but the oysters were fantastic .
i recently visited over this past summer after being away for a year .
the salads are delicious , both refreshing and very spicy .
my husband and i thougt it would be great to go to the jekyll and hyde pub for our anniversary , and to our surprise it was fantastic .
once for dinner and once for brunch .
they have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great .
i 've been back to nha trang literally a hundred times for the beef cubes - they 're that good .
my husband and i enjoyed each of the 6 taste size portions and left completely full .
they have a very diverse menu so its something for everybody .
the menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent .
the portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that .
while their kitchen food is delicious , their sushi is out of this world .
the food is excellent !
it is simply amazing .
they 're are better taiwanese restaurants and they are located in flushing , queens .
after all that , they complained to me about the small tip .
the dinner menu offers a variety of great entrees , including fresh seafood and huge steaks , there 's also a couple of non-meat alternatives .
i take all my nyc guests to vt 's .
the scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .
this place has great indian chinese food .
there 's nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 ( or more ) .
we ordered lamb which was perfectly cooked and tasted awesome .
we went around 9:30 on a friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !
this place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing .
the food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n't like .
wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the uws !
personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights .
i tried a couple other dishes but was n't too impressed .
it was horrible .
i 've eaten at many different indian restaurants .
love yuka .
the ambience is pretty and nice for conversation , so a casual lunch here would probably be best .
the food was boring and expensive .
the wine list is extensive , well priced and covers alot of regions .
kenny the owner is always there and he treats my family like we are part of his family .
i found this restaurant to be one that truly values its patrons .
salads were fantastic .
i wish they would change back to what it was before .
took my mom for mother 's day , and the maitre d' was pretty rude .
the food 's as good as ever .
lloovve this place .
the two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place .
conveniently located too , being right on bedford ave.
your money could easily be better spent elsewhere ( anywhere ) .
the staff is incredibly helpful and attentive .
the other times i 've gone it 's romantic date heaven , you can walk in get a booth by the windows , be treated like a vip in a not-crowded place , with great food and service .
i had lobster bisque it has 2 oz . of maine lobster in it .
being from the south , there are n't any good delis in my area and while watching foods across america on pbs i found out about katz 's deli .
if you want americanized chinese food with your usual watery , generic white sauce , this is your place .
we were offered water for the table but were not told the voss bottles of water were $ 8 a piece .
what a great place .
we thought that this place is using too much of msg cooking in the foods .
great vibe , lots of people .
a different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .
it 's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food .
oh yeah ever on the west side try there sister resturant arties cafe .
the food is decent at best , and the ambience , well , it 's a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , i thought it was just annoying .
these innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible .
toons has recently been redone , so it 's now a very attractive space .
i was pleasantly suprised .
my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .
you must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .
i have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at la lanterna .
just remember , the later you go , the longer you may have to wait .
food is excellent quality for a good restaurant price .
we could only get through an appetizer and cheese fondue .
the portions are very large and the service is fantastic !!
you can get a completely delish martini in a glass ( that 's about 2-1/2 drinks ) for $ 8.50 ( i recommend the vanilla shanty , mmmm ! ) in a great homey setting with great music .
an awesome organic dog , and a conscious eco friendly establishment .
the space is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise .
will not be back .
i never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it .
if you 're looking for authentic hong kong-style food , look no further .
will never be back .
personally i like the margherita pizza better , but they are all good .
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience ) .
other than the crappy service from two individuals , it 's great .
having hunted around for a quiet , romantic , yet not hideously expensive restaurant i stumbled across reviews for la lanterna and gave it a shot .
we ended our great experience by having gulab jamun ( dessert ) recommended by the waiter .
a must try !
not only is the food authentic , but the staff here are practically off-the-boat , they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to food and wine .
not the greatest sushi place , but excellent for a $ 19.95 all you can eat .
my boyfriend ate tuna and it was cooked perfectly !
village is one of those places that scores on all fronts .
just want to warn you all - do n't waste your time and money .
the prix fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough ( both in quantity and quality ) .
southern indian cuisine is still there , too .
you will find yourself returning quite often .
i found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying - fresh and yummy .
try sushimi cucumber roll .
the new york times has reviewed this place three times already , you know it 's going to be good .
the food was excellent - authentic italian cuisine made absolutely fresh .
the outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful .
everytime i go there i ca n't pick anything to eat and not because the menu is filled with great things to eat .
good food at the right price , what more can you ask for .
a beef consomme .
the menu has lots of options : i hope to go back to try those potato pancakes .
the sushi was awful !
the shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful .
food was average but tasty .
the service is a bit slow , but harkens back to my years growing up in napoli , italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night .
i do n't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer .
the problem is just that-it is a sometimes kind of affair .
our tiny table for two ( dinner plates hung over edge ) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic .
we generally like good restaurants and eat out often but kai was way to expensive for what we got .
the hostess is rude to the point of being offensive .
and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ?
always a nice crowd , but never loud .
i decided to try out this place after hearing about it in many magazines .
first went here to enjoy their garden terrace .
good luck getting a table .
the flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal .
at night the atmoshere changes turning into this hidden jewel that is waiting to be discovered .
service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded .
be sure not to get anything other than bagels ! . .
the worst excuse for japanese food i 've ever encountered .
i highly recommend cafe st. bart 's for their food , the ambience and wonderful service .
and the food , well the food will keep you coming back .
unless you are eating in the pizzeria side of this place , and are not in a rush , this place is a bad idea .
probably my worst dining experience in new york , and i 'm a former waiter so i know what i 'm talking about .
but on a lazy saturday night , we ended up going .
great food but the service was dreadful !
the drinks are always well made and wine selection is fairly priced .
it is quite a spectacular scene i 'll give them that .
truly the mark of an attentive waiter .
well ... they can run but they ca n't hide .
the drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced .
this restaurant used to be pretty decent .
i highly recommend caviar russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service .
if you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you 'll love it here .
the food now is inconsistent .
one should not go to lucky strike for the food .
i was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there .
$ 160 for 2 filets , 2 sides , an appetizer and drinks .
thius is a must for anyone who loves shabu-shabu .
their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a ' special ' bagel experience .
great food , lt 's of it , more then one person can eat !
the service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual .
worth the trip from manhattan .
check this place out !
the staff was the friendliest that have seen in new york .
all in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city .
the sushi is cut in blocks bigger than my cell phone .
dip the ingredients in with your chopsticks , swirl them around , and eat .
it took a bigger bite from my wallet than my appetite - i would not reccomend this to anyone that i would want to talk to me again !!
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect , which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me , i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check .
this place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .
my girlfiends and i ate at o.g. again last night .
i 'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service .
i would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard .
it 's not mind-blowing , but to me , thai food never is and never will be .
we ate outside at haru 's sake bar because haru 's restaurant next door was overflowing .
this is the first time citysearch did ' t call it right .
it 's better than being on the roof of sutton place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night .
decent wine selection too .
service and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money .
the manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly .
small servings for main entree , i had salmon ( wasnt impressed ) girlfriend had chicken , it was good .
when we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years .
overall , this is a nice place to take a few friends to hang out at and the service is excellent .
delicious food , excellent service , and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $ 5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch !
not the food , not the ambiance , not the service , i agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out .
while the food was excellent , it was n't cheap ( though not extremely expensive either ) .
friendly and informative staff , very attentive and prompt raw bar service .
no , really .
a nice find in the neighborhood .
we concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake , both were delicious .
a great choice at any cost and a great deal .
the only concern i have is with the slighly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the food down , rushing you out .
got a little loud after 8 pm when the joint got full .
haru on park s is simply disgusting .
definitely a neighborhood favorite .
the ambience was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty .
everyone i have spoken too there is super friendly , helpful , and willing to the extra mile for a customer .
was surprisingly disappointed .
this place is a must visit !
both are delicious , the cooks are friendly and are willing to take a moment and speak to you and shake your hand .
this place is the most japanese it can ever get .
the food was good .
meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger , made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas , carrots and other vegetables and spices .
service is top notch .
chennai garden is my favorite indian restaurant in the city .
it was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap ( undercooked ) beef .
also , they do not take credit card so come with cash !
my boyfriend and i went here last night and loved it !
the pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria 's .
i would n't even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy , too .
my wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it .
the price very reasonable .
they have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great .
little tonino 's is just awesome , our favorite delivery place in kennsington , honestly the best gnochi i have ever had !
we were then shooed inside .
will prob . not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once .
at 5 dumplings for $ 1 , you just can not go wrong .
the manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession .
but they 've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the godmother pizza ( a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual ) .
for the location , the prices are very reasonable .
terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down .
the service is excellent , the decor is great , and the food is delicious and comes in large portions .
we love the food , drinks , and atmosphere !
i have eaten at saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good .
my boyfriend and i recently had an early dinner at artisanal and was satisfied with our experience .
located at the end of a magnificent block .
the fried calamari was even better !
i have dined at mammino several times now and each time it gets bettter .
good food .
i would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i ca n't not mention or undermine .
have been several times and it never dissapoints .
expensive
if you ware looking for korean fusion , i suggest you try some of the places in the east village .
service is fast and friendly .
we all felt it was worth it .
also a little more expensive than your average bagel place .
the food always tastes fresh and served promptly .
we recently spent new year 's eve at the restaurant , and had a great experience , from the wine to the dessert menu .
i went to ruby foo 's after work with a group of 6 .
drinks way over priced .
the food portions are really large .
and even with it 's pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too !
the nakgi-bokum was horrible .
bukhara grill , the tagline says it all . . " indian spice rave "
the lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with scallops and shrimp is great .
excellent dumplings served amid clean , chic decor .
shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service .
i went to this restaurant with a woman that i met recently .
next time , we would n't dare ordering anything else other than some simple asian appetizers and drinks .
based on a visit a month ago , i returned the week before christmas and was hugely disappointed .
ravioli was good ... but i have to say that i found everything a bit overpriced .
we were exploring grand central and did n't want to eat in the food court .
overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites , but everything was delicious .
service is extraordinary , yet not overbearing , and the decor brings a taste of trendy soho into queens .
waiters are very friendly and the pasta is out of this world .
i recieved prompt service with a smile .
certainly not the best sushi in new york , however , it is always fresh , and the place is very clean , sterile .
nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .
butter was melted , white wine warm , cheese oozing everywhere .
i have been twice to this restaurant .
our food was great too !
at first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to present a problem , although the restaurant looked fairly empty , but they hastily put the table together for us .
we a menu that rearely changes , e xcept for one or two specials , the quality and care they put in thier food in evident .
its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of new york .
they were such a rip-off ( $ 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns ) and not worth trying .
my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .
it is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in bay ridge .
the steak melted in my mouth .
so , for good food i 'd recommend it , but not for a fun night out .
the hostess was very pleasant .
my boyfriend and i went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all i can say is that it was magnificent .
our friends have not arrived yet .
if presentation and service is your thing , then this magic show works .
i am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience .
i 'm not sure why these other reviewers are whining so much .
prices are very good .
aside from the rushed service , we were very impressed with the food and the drinks .
do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all cost !
two wasted steaks -- what a crime !
chinatown definitely has better quality with cheaper prices .
would never go back
so , again , give it a try .
i have known about this secret for the last 13 years , emilio ( the godfather ) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices .
we paid a fixed pricce but got nothing !!
i went for restaurant week and ordered off the prix fixe menu
food portion was small and below average .
we all ordered different entrees so we could share .
do n't know what the others on the block were like but we were pleased with our choice .
the entree was bland and small , dessert was not inspired .
ambience is delightful , service impeccable .
but they do .
patsy 's pizza = true love
this was one of the best restaurants i 've ever been to .
such nice people working here - but i have to review the food .
the people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in new york sometimes .
i went to del frisco 's friday night with my boyfriend for an 8:00 reservation .
also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in - quite a weird selection .
there is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me .
i had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible .
just bring someone who speaks cantonese because waiter may not understand you .
it hits the spot every time
the staff offers impeccable service .
my friend from milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian .
my boyfriend and i were in ny for a few days and pastis was a place that came recommended .
we are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included : ceviche mix special , crab dumplings , assorted sashimi , sushi and rolls , two types of sake , and the banana tempura .
i tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .
whenever you need a sushi fix , mizu will be there with quality fish and great service .
there is not a single place in chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here .
i am going to the mid town location next .
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience ) .
on a recent sunday afternoon , a friend and i accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play doubt .
after dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : where are you from ... maybe you dont know how things work in america ... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on .
i have lived in japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in japan .
and the prices were way to high for what you get .
my boyfriend had the new england chowder it was good but i think the award should go to the lobster bisque .
a restaurant that does n't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere .
i will not be coming here at 3 am again .
it 's a great place to pick up a cheap lunch or dinner .
skip nathan 's ... you can get that at the mall ... go to bark .
the dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages , sardines with biscuits , large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream ( the best and freshest i 've ever had ) .
service was devine , oysters where a sensual as they come , and the price ca n't be beat !!!
who said go when the place is quiet during the day ?
just walk by the window and see all the unbiased positive reviews in all the major nyc publications .
i thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others .
the well mannered , pleasant staff that tony has in his employ .
its located in greenewich village .
great people watching as others do the same to you .
she just nodded and walked off .
i visit new green bo when i have money or when i am broke .
the soup is pretty good too .
harumi sushi has the freshest and most delicious array of sushi in nyc .
the first time i went , and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere , i ordered the lobster cobb salad .
the seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .
i 've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences .
the hot dogs were cold in the middle and the buns were stale .
for out-of-towners who will get a big thrill out of the location !
i stopped by for some brunch today and had the vegan cranberry pancakes and some rice milk .
the food is very good too but for the most part , it 's just regular food , nothing special .
everything i had was good , and i 'm a eater .
i will be returning .
try everything for that matter , it is all good .
this place is great .
pastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high ( ask for extra rye bread ) .
in the evening , this place attracted a well dressed , with it , ny crowd .
i also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee rice porridge .
the quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied .
the combination of fresh tomato sauce , fresh mozz cheese , basil and the dough they make with imported flour , makes this is one of the better pizza 's in ny .
not only is the cuisine the best around , the service has always been attentive and charming .
the sushi is also great !
this was the perfect quiet , relaxing , and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater .
i actually gave patroon another chance before writing this , but the second visit was even worse .
whether it 's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar , you will surely be transported to northern italy with one bite .
it just was n't thai .
not enough wines by the glass either .
how do you rate home ?
my husband and i both ordered the steak , medium .
la rosa waltzes in , and i think they are doing it the best .
fantastic place .
the wait staff is very freindly , they make it feel like you 're eating in a freindly little european town .
this is the kind of place you 'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret .
the staff makes you feel at home , the food is great and the atmosphere is wonderful !
yeah shanghai is also great but not quite as good -- they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out .
be aware .
our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken ( usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats ) .
trust me , it will be great , and all of it will be devoured in no time .
although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great .
bleecker st pizza is the best !
great pizza and fantastic service .
their sake list was extensive , but we were looking for purple haze , which was n't listed but made for us upon request !
from the street it looks very hidden , and is actually an old warehouse .
i live a block away and go to patsy 's frequently .
to speak of the park side , words can not describe .
over all it was a very nice romantic place .
this was my frist time at cafe st. bart 's and i must say how delicous the food and the service was .
drinks : 2 glasses of dom perignon at $ 35 each .
cute place , nice wait staff but would never go there again .
great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work .
the design of the space is good .
the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .
mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) .
food and service was okay .
have eaten at ginger house several times , and it 's always good .
of course , it is crowded but who cares .
not only have i worked in restaurants for many years , i am now in culinary school , i am a huge lover of oysters and fish , and my girlfriend is half korean !
the steak tartare is a great bet , they fix it for you at the table .
i lived in maine for ten years and grew up on fish .
the food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare , the dishes are never a disappointment .
a + + the service was good to excellent along with the attitude .
i would have gotten some cole slaw and a knish if my stomach had more space .
the puke green walls leave a lot to be desired , but the food is very good .
every course was better than the next .
surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth .
head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st , taj mahal is also very comparable , in food quality , to the much overpraised ( and underdeserving ) baluchi 's .
we ended our great experience by having gulab jamun dessert recommended by the waiter .
please do n't fool us .
if it is n't for the food ( a + + + ) , it must be the service or the ambience .
and i 've been to many nyc delis .
decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing !
i/we will never go back to this place again .
my friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos .
but the meals were terrible .
the best pad thai i 've ever had .
it 's very spicy but not offensive .
the corned beef was tender and melted in my mouth .
love the atmosphere - felt like i was in paris .
single worst restaurant in manhattan
a pleasant surprise .
the service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing !
if your favorite chinese food is general tao chicken , then this is not your place .
the service varys from day to day - sometimes they 're very nice , and sometimes not .
nice place though .
since i cook for a living , i 'm very fussy about the food i eat in restaurants .
check out the secret back room .
while this is a pretty place in that overly cute french way , the food was insultingly horrible .
if you 'd like to have a nice light meal with an asian accent , long tan is a good place on the slope .
it does n't look like much on the outside , but the minute you walk inside , it 's a whole other atmosphere .
everything was wonderful ; food , drinks , staff , mileau .
lol
we had a good time .
saul is the best restaurant on smith street and in brooklyn .
fish was overdone .
the service was attentive , yet unimposing , the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced .
would not recommend anyone to go .
i work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time .
outstanding bagels , but you get what you pay for .
if you 're craving for haru 's great food , especially the house roll , but ca n't stand the wait building outisde , head across the street to their sake bar !
you can not go wrong with this place .
i went there with a few friends and will return .
we had fun eating in there , we were there like around 3 a.m. in the morning !
it is thick and slightly soggy .
i thought i had died and gone to heaven .
no more reservations , expensive tips and annoying stuff .
we will return many times for this oasis in mid-town .
when going out for a nice dinner , i like a nice ambiance as well as very good food .
this place is not worth the prices .
the staff is very good .
we had pam 's special fried fish and it was amazing .
great indian food and the service is incredible .
the service was dreadfully slow ( the place was only half full ) and a smile would have been nice ...
the rest of the dim sum , though pricey by chinatown standards , is worth it .
great for groups , great for a date , great for early brunch or a nightcap .
this establishment is the real deal .
i understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .
we left , never to return .
stick with the chicken , beef , and lamb dishes .
i 'm amazed we have n't been kicked out of this place yet .
drawbacks : service is slow and they do n't toast !
price is high but the food is good , so i would come back again .
and you never get the feeling that you need to leave .
you can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation .
it 's simply the best meal in nyc .
i had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll .
i just have nothing to say about this place that is negative except that it 's not a cheap night out ... but it 's so worth it .
the staff is unbelievably friendly , and i dream about their saag gosht ... so good .
we got a little tipsy from the sake but is n't that what saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about ?
the service was excellent and the food was delicious .
i came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband .
some of the finest latin women you 'll see in your life hang out at jimmy 's .
this is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the basil slice .
the sicilian is my favorite it is moist not dry like most places but all their pizza is great !
but too far east !
culinaria is a welcome addition to the garment district - far better than any restaurant in the area .
on that scale , it 's a world-beater .
this has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in brooklyn .
but warning : to all those that use this site be weary , be very weary of recommendations .
the place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic .
rather than preparing vegetarian dish , the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables ( minus sauce , seasoning , or any form or aesthetic presentation ) .
but $ 1 for each small piece ???
however , our main course was wonderful .
our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese .
my boyfriend and i have been to the minnow four times now and we have consistently been impressed .
they all know you .
the fish was really , really fresh .
the bagel was huge .
i visit new green bo when i have money or when i am broke .
the food was very good and i was pleasantly surprised to see so many vegan options .
has the warmth of a family local yet it is a great place to watch sporting events .
you 'll pay at least double at any other italian restaurant in the city , and most still do n't compare .
i love this cozy around the way rest .
every time i have a special occasion with my boyfriend i have a hard time going anywhere else .
the $ 300 bill was a bit steep , but the experience was great .
if that 's a problem , go to mcdonald 's and destroy your insides .
the calamari comes with an incredible sauce , and the duck noodles are yummy as well .
i have been in many restaurants all over the city and roth 's steakhouse has quickly become one of my favorites .
i highly recommend this beautiful place .
i loved it and would go again .
would not return for the amount we paid .
excellent food for great prices
after all that , they complained to me about the small tip .
i 'm told that it is open 24 hrs which is good .
15 % gratuity automatically added to the bill .
my girlfriend and i stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !
most importantly , it is reasonably priced .
hats off to the chef .
this is n't your corner chinese food takeout .
downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
i have been going back again and again .
great neighborhood joint .
planet thai is great !
this restaurant used to be our regular thursday night dinner location .
everything is always cooked to perfection , the service is excellent , the decor cool and understated .
yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken .
this restaurant is such a great place .
the service was attentive .
the level of rudeness was preposterous .
i 've eaten at pizza gruppo a few times , but more often i order delivery .
the staff is very sharp and they look good too .
while the smoothies are a little big for me , the fresh juices are the best i have ever had !
i had never had edamame pureed before but i thought it was innovative and tasty ( could 've used a bit more salt ) .
i was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they dont have .
then , if they answer the phone , you 're lucky if they do n't hang up on you !
if you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo .
the waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away .
they are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine , so if you want to make a reservation you are limited .
price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit .
their whitefish salad is excellent -- all whitefish with a little mayo .
we were there march 7 and found maison very nice .
in fact , this was not a nicoise salad and was barely eatable .
dinner took almost 4 hours without any lag time .
i 'll keep this short .
all-time favorites include the big mac , chicken mcnuggets , filet-o-fish sandwich and mcdonald 's famous french fries ; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available .
drawbacks : service is slow and they do n't toast !
food was okay , nothing great .
this is n't a value joint .
the dishes are remarkably tasty and such a cozy and intimate place !
i was very impressed by this low-key upper eastsider and their authentically thai cuisine !!!
stay away
just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday .
i came here for my friend 's birthday and keep coming back ever since .
highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and service .
the have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious , if i must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini .
my mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant .
by the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !
i ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .
the food was great .
service here was great , food was fantastic .
( that is a must , but not every restaurant can do ... )
the sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day .
i started out with a bombay beer which was big enough for two .
my six year old loved it .
it takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something ( although they dont forget to charge you for it .
the food was not very tasty , the portioins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant .
the room is a little plain , but it 's difficult to make such a small place exciting and i would not suggest that as a reason not to go .
i was n't impressed and it was n't spicey ????
i have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials .
you ca n't go wrong with this place .
after reading the posts , i was always skeptical to go to the minnow , despite living in park slope .
if it 's just a quick martini at the bar ( which i recommend jeffery 's ) or a mind blowing roast chicken , go to village !
bon appettite !!
the spicy tuna and salmon are the best we 've ever had .
stuffing yourself with japanese food is a rare thing .
i ca n't wait to go back .
you will be satisfied .
the service was excellent - friendly and attentive .
my daughter and i left feeling satisfied ( not stuffed ) and it felt good to know we had a healthy lunch .
first of all , this place is * not * romantic , as claimed by citysearch 's editorial review .
seriously , this is the best all you can eat in town - as everyone says , the spicy tuna hand rolls are the best - have 4 of these , and you 've broken even .
the ambience is also more laid-back and relaxed .
but i 'd go back
the folding chair i was seated at was uncomfortable .
you ca n't say its cheap because food is cheaper in chinatown .
this is one of our all-time favorite .
i was so stunned , and i left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing .
it 's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street .
i have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at la lanterna .
it 's a basic pizza joint , not much to look at , but the pizza is what i go for .
my date and i both ordered the branzini and both felt the fish was very average .
we always get a sampling of appetizers and share .
the bagel was huge .
sushi was n't anything spectacular for the price .
my fiance and i recently wanted to see the city and deceided to take a dinner cruise .
the octopus eaters were floored by the octopus salad .
this is a typical example of an establishment in which its owners do not know anything about the restaurant business !
food was okay , nothing great .
when he finally did , he was unable to make a gin and tonic -- could n't find tonic .
i came across village underground by accident , now i go there all the time .
i love their chicken pasta cant remember the name but is sooo good
had 1 appetizer , 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~ $ 55.00 , not including tip .
i went there with my friend last saturday .
always full with tourists ( especially because of it 's close proximity to rockefeller center ) .
the four seasons restaurant is a great experience .
both times we waited well over a half hour for a table ( even though we had reservations ) .
as far as the service goes , the waitresses were not particularly friendly , but they got the job done .
( 1 ) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of mott st. just south of bayard
i never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending !
always busy but fast moving .
the sake complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world .
we were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .
this tiny williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising .
i highly recommend this restaurant !!
the only thing the waiters do n't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave .
just go and see for yourself .
it 's traditional , simple italian food .
as a japanese native , i 've lived in the tristate area for over 8 years , but i was just so amazed at this place .
the service is friendly , if not the most prompt in the world , the food is great , and the prices , while not cheap , wo n't put your wallet out of commission .
never got an explanation as to what was going on .
if you are in the area try the bagel shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd ave.
skip this location and go to the one in soho .
go hungry and enjoy .
appetizers took nearly an hour .
once you step into cosette , you 're miraculously in a small , off-the-beaten path parisian bistro .
i like cafe noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent !!
do n’t go to this place !
i took my boyfriend for a dinner on saturday night .
the food is usually good but it certainly is n't a relaxing place to go .
and for this i had to shell out a small fortune ?
the flavors robust and subtle .
i had the best ravioli ever .
the counter service is bad .
whether it 's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar , you will surely be transported to northern italy with one bite .
terrible would be a compliment !
they all know you .
creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary-orange sauce are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu .
the service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served .
we figured we never had argentinian pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there , sharing a large pelligrino , a pizza of two of their specials , one was goat cheese the other blue cheese , and both were excellent .
the food is authentic italian - delicious !
fabulous decor - makes you feel like you 're in a trendy manhattan restaurant , very very good food , cheaply-priced , generally friendly staff , and if you 're a manhattanite , or spend most of your time in manhattan , rice avenue will make you feel at home ..... very soho/village/upper west side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele ..... all on roosevelt avenue !
a coworker and i tried pacifico after work a few fridays and loved it .
it 's easy to get a table for a large group and you do n't get hustled out .
despite the untasteful previous review ...
the place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what i could tell , a reasonable wine list ( i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins )
you ca n't go wrong here .
the exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations .
too bad latin quarters closed .
five of us walked in at approximately 6:20 on a thursday evening .
even if the food was n't this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .
it is what modern cuisine is all about .
never fails to please .
i go twice a month !
i also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee ( rice porridge ) .
as many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time .
recommended .
but the thai is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished .
there are much better places in ny with better prices .
i was wrong .
and never strayed .
i was highly disappointed by the food .
( food was delivered by a busboy , not waiter ) we got no cheese offered for the pasta , our water and wine glasses remained empty our entire meal , when we would have easily spent another $ 20 on wine .
it was our only opportunity to visit and wanted an authentic italian meal .
great bagels , spreads and a good place to hang out in .
sum it : local investment bankers like it , try for yourself at least once .
i 'd definitely recommend this little place .
the buffet had a nice selection .
the best place to bring kids or any friends who want to do something different .
this is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent .
the decor is nice , but more casual than fine dining .
great sushi experience .
to finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert , especially the white chocolate bread pudding with gelato and hot chocolate .
top spot in town for vietnamese classics , better than places that cost a lot more .
$ 6 and there is much tasty food , all of it fresh and continually refilled .
you get what you pay for and with that logic in mind , spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful setting .
great neighborhood joint .
the portion sizes here are huge , and the sushi is good .
one of the best
i recomend the chicken milanese .
i ca n't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food !
it is simply amazing .
i just do n't understand all the hype ...
it 's a small cute restaurant .
ive passed by the spot tons of times always wanting to go in .
pricey , but worth a try , at least once .
i recommend it !
one would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .
all in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city .
the pizza is yummy and i like the atmoshpere .
their eggplant is so delicate , sweet tender !
polite acknowledgement is out ;
having been a long time ess-a-bagel fan , i was surpised to find myself return time and time again to murray 's .
the lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it .
the wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for chinatown ) alternative .
this is the best shabu-shabu restaurant in the try-state area .
i thought this place was totally overrated .
overall , excellent restaurant !
i often find myself with time to kill in times square , which is a shame since i do n't love this area .
we were a group of 8 and well seved .
i often go there to eat with my family .
i could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched - so watch out .
i love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine cuisine , even with no idea how to use them .
i definitely enjoyed the food as well .
for those of you who do n't know , uni is sea urchin in japanese , which happens to be my favorite . )
traditional french decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .
i can not imagine better indian food in all of the city .
we had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful .
taj mahal offeres gret value and great food .
i ordered the chicken teriyaki and my husband got garlic shrimp .
the food was good , the service prompt , and the price very reasonable .
went there for an office lunch .
the food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates .
ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away .
they 're are better taiwanese restaurants and they are located in flushing , queens .
the staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely .
they did give a 15 % discount at the end , was n't enough , as they knew the service was horrible .
i highly reccomend the grand marnier shrimp , it 's insanely good .
it was divine melts in your mouth .
if you want good tasting , well seasoned latin food eat at cabana and you ca n't go wrong .
go only if you are already in the neighborhood and do n't want to bother going farther for a better place .
the table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry , i understood they were busy .
dessert - ca n't be missed , so save room !!!
we love th pink pony .
we all ate pasta entre'es , which were great .
don pedro 's is one of my favorite restaurants .
there are no negatives to speak of .
though it 's been crowded most times i 've gone here , bark always delivers on their food .
the service is a quite slow , but friendly .
i live in the neightborhood and am a regular .
the chicken dinner was real good .
lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty food on the cheap -- you 'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for four dollars .
anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet , where greasy , dry and tasteless are complimentary .
it 's simply the best meal in nyc .
it 's a perfect place to have a amazing indian food .
which lets face it .... at times it 's a good thing .
very " normal indian food " , but done really well .
jimmy is dominican !
also it 's great to have dinner in a very romantic and comfortable place , the service it 's just perfect ... they 're so frendly that we never want to live the place !
both times i was extremely dissappointed by the service , which was boarderline rude .
the view is spectacular , and the food is great .
the seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .
i did n't expect to like nosh as much as i did , but the pastrami on challah sandwich i had was otherworldly , the soups are like mom 's , and the knishes give yonah schimmel 's a run for its money .
loved it !
service is fast and friendly .
this place does n't compare with mamoun 's in terms of price , freshness , value , and consisent quality , but that 's just my opinion .
authentic shanghai style and i can not recommend a better shanghai place in new york .
i ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef , and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked thai flavors in unexpected ways .
the wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal .
i 'm not even going to bother to describe it ; it speaks for itself .
we have been there 3 times since last week we alked it by chance first day the manager offerd us the margherita pizza adn we said yes .
we have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip , and the food was delivered quickly , but we live only a few minutes walk from them .
it first came well done , and i politely sent it back .
my chicken was completely dried out and on the cold side and the sauce was not very flavorful .
go to any corned indian restaurant , and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme !
i consider the best grand sichuan restaurant in nyc .
considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time , the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed .
this is the pinnacle of indian fast food ( all fast foods in my opinion ) .
i 'm just reading some of these reviews and its nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud .
this is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together .
went to ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza ( as i love la pizza fresca ) .
this place is great .
prices are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good .
my husband and i have been there at least 6 times and we 've always been given the highest service and often free desserts .
very neighborhoody , very quick and sufficient .
the staff is accomodating , the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed , and the food is out of this world !
since the first time i came here i 've been hooked .
amazing interior .
the food here does a great service to the name ( cantonese that is ... ) .
i went here in the afternoon with a friend .
skip baroanda down the street ( eurotrashy , snooty and expensive ) and check this place out !
fresh , mind blowing flavors .
we were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd .
still , any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ...
i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever .
less wait time for me !
i do not recommend the heartland brewery .
finally a reliable chinese restaurant !
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret .
was there friday night .
thank you emilio .
personally i say save your money .
this place has the best chinese style bbq ribs in the city .
we did n't want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of korbett it was just enough .
the waitress came by to pick up the soy sauce while we were eating our lunch !!!!!
this place must have cost the owners afortune to build .
and the bill was outragous .
loved it
they were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior .
the staff offers impeccable service .
the place is beautiful !
how can they survive serving mediocre food at exorbitant prices ?!
i really liked the noodle dishes at rice avenue compared to their green curry dish .
nice view of river and nyc .
pick a bagel has the best bagels in the city .
we have tried every thai restaurant between atlantic avenue and 4th streets , and joya is the best .
this place was reccomended to me by a friend .
my picks are : - scallion pancake ( fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty ) - guizhou chicken - shredded squid family style ( one of my personal favorites ) - sichuan spicy soft shell crab - shuizhu fish ( this one is for hardcore sichuan food fans , i would n't recommend to my american friends as it 's very spicy .
the homemade guacamole , the unbelievable entree , and thee most amazing deserts .
has the chef and owner changed ???
i went with jwils .
i would go back .
i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled .
you must try the shrimp appetizers .
great spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner .
the pickles were great addition .
even the wine by the glass was good .
i have lived in japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in japan .
the sake menu should not be overlooked !
best restaurant in brooklyn
we asked for beverages and never received them .
i am happy i did the food was awsome .
the crab cakes are delicious and the bbq rib was perfect .
so , the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious .
all in all the food was above average and i would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners .
went on a 3 day oyster binge , with fish bringing up the closing , and i am so glad this was the place it o trip ended , because it was so great !
saul is the best restaurant on smith street and in brooklyn .
do not try unless you 're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste .
a real dissapointment .
brick oven gallery is my pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere .
there are many thai places in the city but so far toons is # 1 .
not cheap but very yummy .
to celebrate a birthday , three of us went to mare anticipating great food .
want to impress ?
only wine and beer are served , but the house varities are actually quite good .
the lox is always fresh too .
when you add it all together , it just does n't seem worth it to me ... especially considering the prices .
we ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin .
no you 're going to go back because the food was good .
the icing made this cake , it was fluffy , not ultra sweet , creamy and light .
there is a downside if you 're ordering in -- the delivery guys have major attitude .
mermaid inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .
ruth , mother of the bride
this place is to be avoided .
i 've always been seated propmtly .
i asked for seltzer with lime , no ice .
looking around , i saw a room full of new yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen .
after the main course came , we did n't see our waiter for at least 40 minutes !
we went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a saturday , and i was thoroughly impressed with the food .
it seems like this is a place the locals like and the people working here liked it too .
otherwise , good stuff for late nite eats .
we had a girls ' night dinner here for restaurant week .
they sell special sushi , everything have a topping , sauce and etc .
he has visited thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine .
the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality .
the appetizing is excellent - just as good as zabars barney greengrass at a reasonable price ( if bought by the pound ) .
i go back in line like three times on average until i ca n't walk anymore .
bill a little high , but worth it .
given the incredible architecture surrounding it , this place has no character .
the food was good overall .
no plans to return anytime soon .
try the sea bass .
this place has been around for a few years .
i 've been to sotto voce several time , and i have to say this one place that hits the nail right on the head ever time !
for the people who want great food plus great service , roxy is a place to avoid !
i just read mocaramel 's review and felt compelled to respond .
service was excellent , and the ac worked very well too ( thank god , it was hot ! ) .
the food was absolutely horrible !
the ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .
i was pleasantly suprised .
avoid this place !
i have been in nyc for over 10 years and could not find this delicacy east of the hudson .
murray wo n't do it .
they refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends .
it 's the kind of place i like to support !
no green beans , no egg , no anchovy dressing , no nicoise olives , no red onion .
you wo n't find that anywhere in manhattan .
i liked the beer selection !
$ 500 included :
the menu is interesting and quite reasonably priced .
i have to say that i am pleasantly suprised and i will most likely stop in again if i am in the neighborhood .
only drawback - they wo n't toast your bagel , and they do n't make eggs for the bagel .
i have been going there since it opened and i ca n't get enough .
we paid and left because we did n't feel like arguing any more .
i 've made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby ( i live on uws ) .
normally that would be improper , however they were all delicious and my host did not complain .
the food options rule .
however , for what we spent , overall , it just was not up to par .
this is such a lovely , peaceful place to eat outside .
mojitos and the service are the best part in there
i 'm telling you ...
they used shredded cheese on top !
over the years the host , vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family -- although with all the business this not-so-little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor .
the place was quiet and delightful .
i had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that was n't as good .
the owner and staff are all japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance .
as much as i like the food there , i ca n't bring myself to go back .
fresh ingredients and everything is made to order .
i 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !
read all the other review , they 'll confirm it .
i was at rao 's last wed .
highly recommend it !
it 's super-trendy and there 's always someone to take that empty seat , so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence .
bartender was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar .
i have never in my life sent back food before , but i simply had to , and the waiter argued with me over this .
the service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served .
the all you can eat deal is truly amazing here .
not only was the food outstanding , but the little ' perks ' were great .
give it a try and enjoy .
i do not think dinner in manhattan should cost $ 400.00 where i am not swept off my feet .
the food however , is what one might expect .
go here .
fantastic !
i 'll be back for sure .
i recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one .
chennai garden is my favorite indian restaurant in the city .
pizza is terrific , as is homemade pasta .
i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .
best taiwanese food in ny !
this place is average ... at best .
the seafood is amazing , there 's a good wine list , and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises .
decor is nice and minimalist , food simple yet very well presented and cooked , and the wine list matches the food very well .
i went to areo on a sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends , and spent three enjoyable hours there .
to sum it up : service varies from good to mediorce , depending on which waiter you get ; generally it is just average ok .
go here if you want fresh and tasty salads of any type you can imagine .
kudos to po !
if this restaurant was in manhattan , i would definitely go more often .
the brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal .
bay terrace mall is nothing ( ok , almost nothing ) without it !
priced at upper intermediate range .
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives .
it looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips .
people are rude bit again it 's new york !
we were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial .
we concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake , both were delicious .
price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit .
a few tips : skip the turnip cake , roast pork buns and egg custards .
please be aware that it 's cash or amex only !
we ordered the chicken casserole , but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken , all dark meat and on the bone .
prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant .
i was a little leary about mary 's at first - it 's small , crowded and you usually have to wait on line - but i 'm glad i finally tried it .
( i hang out , and live , in the neighborhood . . )
service was very good and warm .
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives .
small servings for main entree , i had salmon ( wasnt impressed ) girlfriend had chicken , it was good .
- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes , however be warned that the peter 's favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top , like a salad .
heartland brewery is by far one of the best places in nyc to make new friends and catch up with old ones .
everyone is welcomed in as family .
i found the food , service and value exceptional everytime i have been there .
the food was excellent as well as service , however , i left the four seasons very dissappointed .
other guests enjoyed pizza , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips .
not cheap , but not that expensive either .
spice is sleek , modern and cool with a menu that will not hurt your wallet .
their calzones are horrific , bad , vomit-inducing , yuck .
the negative reviews on city search are probably from jealous competing restaurants who realize they ca n't compete with temple 's entire positive attitude about the proper way to treat their customers and deliver top quality food .
i really liked this place .
cool atmosphere , the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night .
searching to get out from the cold , freezing weather , we went into what we thought was a deli .
the porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless , so was the seafood tagliatelle .
i did n't complain , i liked the atmosphere so much .
the sake menu should not be overlooked !
the food was undercooked - the sauce watery , and the vegetables raw .
